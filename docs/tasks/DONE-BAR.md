# DONE-BAR: `Done` means SOTA / SIGNOFF-LEVEL done — a user can blindly trust the parser: stimuli-generator proof AND all gates AND all external corpus, and the trust that establishes

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `DONE-BAR`
- Status: `active` (opened 2026-07-29, session #221)
- Family / slice-id prefix: `PGEN-DONE-BAR-<NNNN>`
- Created: `2026-07-29`
- Owner: repo-local workflow
- Director directive: [[feedback_done_bar_is_first_tier_only]]
- Frontier: **`.1`** (the audit)

## Goal

Every parser family that claims `Done` in `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md` meets **all four legs**,
currently and simultaneously:

1. **stimuli-generator proof** — the family's own generated samples close the loop, zero residual
   actionable-target debt;
2. **all our gates** — every gate covering the family is green *now*, and is actually invoked by
   something;
3. **all the external test corpus** — an officially-recognized third-party corpus, **passing** —
   not triaged, not characterized.

...and the arbiter the three legs exist to establish:

4. **blind-trust worthiness** — *"sota, signoff level … user can now blindly trust the parser"*
   (director, verbatim). No known open defect against the family, a current published integration
   contract, documented acceptance boundaries, no known silent-failure mode.

⛔ **Legs 1-3 are NECESSARY, not SUFFICIENT.** A family can pass all three and still fail leg 4, and
then it is not `Done`. The checklist must never become a way to certify something a careful engineer
would not stake work on. The operative test: *would I tell a downstream team to build on this parser
without re-verifying it, and would I be right?*

Rows that do not meet all four are **demoted**, visibly, with the unmet leg named.

## ⭐⭐⭐ THE FLOW SHALL GUARANTEE THIS 100% (director 2026-07-29, verbatim) — this is the tree's GOVERNING requirement

> *"So the flow shall guarantee this 100%"*

⇒ **the bar is not a checklist someone remembers to apply; it is an invariant the flow enforces.** A
`Done` row that does not meet all four legs must be **impossible to hold**, because a gate fails
while it is held. This reorders the tree: `.4` (enforcement) is not the tidy-up at the end, it is the
point, and `.1`-`.3` are what make enforcement possible.

⛔ **AND THE FLOW CANNOT DELIVER THAT GUARANTEE TODAY — measured, not asserted.** Three findings from
`CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT`, all already in the record, compose into a hard blocker:

| # | measured fact | consequence for the guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sota_exit_gate` — the aggregate that would prove the families — **has never completed green**; best run 2026-07-29 is 32 gates entered / 30 ok / 1 fail at 5 h 05 m | there is no single green proof surface to enforce against |
| 2 | **the AUTOMATIC tier over all 123 gate targets is ZERO** (`.6`): 14 of 15 workflows are `workflow_dispatch`-only, and the one that auto-runs invokes no `make` target | nothing re-proves a `Done` row unless a human asks |
| 3 | the family status gates are reachable **only** through that aggregate | a row can rot for months undetected — exactly how `regex` held `Done` against a gate that disagreed |

⇒ ⭐ **"the flow guarantees the Done bar" is BLOCKED ON `CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT.7` (aggregate green) AND
on the escalated director call about resuming hosted auto-triggers** (`.6`, which spends Actions
minutes and was deliberately not taken unilaterally). Those are not separate projects from this one —
they are this one's prerequisites, and that is now written down rather than discovered later.

⚠️ **HONEST BOUND ON THE WORD "100%", stated up front rather than discovered in an audit.** A
pre-commit hook is bypassable (`--no-verify`), and a locally-run gate proves only the machine that
ran it. The strongest honest guarantee available is: **enforced on every commit through the hook AND
re-proved by an automatic CI lane that no contributor controls.** Leg 2 of the bar already says a
gate nothing invokes does not count as green — the same standard applied to the enforcement of the
bar itself. Anything less gets *stated*, never quietly claimed as 100%.

## Non-Goals

- Lowering the bar to fit the current state. The directive is explicit: *"no 2nd or 3rd tier Done."*
- Silently rewriting history. Dated tracker notes that were correct when written stay; the **current**
  row is what moves.
- Deciding regex's specific residual debt here — that is `REGEX-PCRE2-FIDELITY.ROUTED-IN-2`. This
  tree owns the **bar**, not each family's remediation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A re-runnable audit reports, per family, the state of each of the four legs, with its own ground
  truth so it says `MISCALIBRATED` rather than reporting a comfortable number.
- Every `Done` row either survives the audit with evidence, or is demoted with the unmet leg named.
- The bar is **enforced**, not just documented, so a row cannot drift back to `Done` without the
  four legs — mechanized once the audit's shape is known (⛔ price before mechanizing:
  `GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.4`'s rule).

## ⭐ THE MEASURED STARTING POINT (2026-07-29, before any remediation)

Taken at directive time. **Leg 3 is the one the repo is furthest from.**

**Corpus-facing gate targets, all 6 of them:**

| gate | family | kind |
|---|---|---|
| `regex_broader_corpus_proof_gate` | regex | proof |
| `regex_pcre2_textsafe_corpus_gate` | regex | proof |
| `regex_corpus_bundle_contract_gate` | regex | contract |
| `verilog_2005_conformance_gate` | verilog_2005 profile | conformance |
| `sv_external_corpus_triage_gate` | systemverilog | ⚠️ **triage** |
| `vhdl_external_corpus_triage_gate` | vhdl | ⚠️ **triage** |

**External corpus bundles that exist:** `regex_corpus_bundle/`, `json_corpus_bundle/` — and the
JSON one is self-described as *"a characterization, not a conformance gate"*.

⇒ **first-pass reading, to be confirmed by `.1`:** of the families currently claiming `Done`
(`systemverilog_preprocessor`, `vhdl`, `regex`, `return_annotation`, `rtl_frontend`), **only `regex`
has a genuine external-corpus lane — and `regex` is the family currently FAILING its own status
gate.** `systemverilog_preprocessor`, `return_annotation` and `rtl_frontend` appear to have **no
external corpus at all**; `vhdl`'s is triage.

⚠️ **That is a first-pass reading from gate names and directory listings, not a per-family audit.**
It is recorded as the hypothesis `.1` must confirm or refute — ⛔ **not** as a finding. This session
has already produced three instrument defects from exactly this kind of shortcut (a redirect counted
as a read, `systemveriLOG` matching `log`, and a family grep that assumed the `systemverilog_` prefix
when the gate is named `sv_`).

### ⚠️ A LEG-4 SIGNAL, RECORDED AS A HYPOTHESIS

`docs/contracts/PGEN_RELEASED_PARSER_BUG_LEDGER.md` contains **24 occurrences of the token `open`**
(against 102 `fixed`, 72 `closed`, 18 `resolved`). ⛔ **That is a token tally, not a count of open
defects** — `open` occurs in prose too. It is recorded because a released-parser ledger with genuinely
open entries is a direct leg-4 blocker for whichever families they name, and `.1` must resolve it to
actual per-family open-defect counts rather than leaving it as an impression.

## Leaves

### `.1` — audit every `Done` claim against the four legs (`todo`)

- **Status: `todo`** — the tree's frontier. Nothing started; no partial state.
- **Scope:**
  1. Enumerate every row claiming `Done` in the parser-family tables of
     `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md` — **derived from the file**, not hand-listed (a hand-list cannot
     see a row nobody added to it).
  2. For each, establish per leg:
     - **leg 1**: the family's residual actionable-target debt and certificate-coverage state, from
       the gates' own artifacts — not from prose;
     - **leg 2**: which gates cover it, whether each is currently green, and whether anything
       actually invokes it (reuse `check_gate_reachability.sh`'s tier model);
     - **leg 3**: whether an officially-recognized external corpus exists, whether it is asserted as
       a **pass** rather than triaged/characterized, and what it currently reports.
  2b. **leg 4**: per-family open-defect count from the released-parser bug ledger, contract currency,
      and whether the family's acceptance boundary is documented where a consumer would find it.
  3. Ship it as a **re-runnable, self-calibrating** instrument, with pinned ground-truth facts that
     make it print `MISCALIBRATED` and exit nonzero rather than report a number it cannot back.
  4. Report, per family, `MEETS BAR` / `DOES NOT MEET BAR (leg N unmet: …)`, with leg 4 judged explicitly rather than inferred from legs 1-3.
- ⛔ **Do NOT demote rows inside `.1`.** Audit first, adjudicate second — this session has twice paid
  for the opposite order. Demotions land in `.2` with the evidence attached.
- ⚠️ **Expect the audit to fail several rows.** That is the directive working. The instrument must
  not be tuned until the answer is comfortable.

### `.2` — demote what does not meet the bar, with the unmet leg named (`todo`)

- **Status: `todo`** — blocked on `.1`.
- Each demoted row states which leg is unmet and what would close it. The dated historical notes are
  left intact; the **current** row is what moves ([[feedback_done_bar_is_first_tier_only]]).

### `.3` — close the external-corpus gap (`todo`)

- **Status: `todo`** — blocked on `.1`'s per-family leg-3 result.
- Likely the largest body of work in this tree: acquiring/vendoring an officially-recognized corpus
  for families that have none, and promoting `triage`/`characterization` surfaces into asserted
  conformance where the parser can actually meet them.
- ⚠️ Where a family genuinely cannot have an external corpus, that needs a **recorded,
  director-visible justification** — absence is an unmet leg, not an inapplicable one.

### `.4` — THE GUARANTEE: the flow enforces the bar, so a false `Done` cannot be held (`todo`)

- **Status: `todo`** — the tree's **highest-value leaf** per the director's *"the flow shall guarantee
  this 100%"*; sequenced after `.1`/`.2` only because enforcement needs the audit's shape first.
- **Requirement:** a `Done` row that does not meet all four legs makes a gate FAIL. Not a report, not
  a warning — the `GATE-REACHABILITY` / `FLOW-INTEGRITY` ratchet shape, which this repo has now
  shipped twice and which is the worked template.
- ⛔ **Prerequisites, measured and named above, not discovered later:** `CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT.7` (the
  aggregate must be able to go green) and the escalated hosted-auto-trigger call (`.6`) — without an
  automatic lane, the enforcement is itself in the OPERATOR tier, which is the exact rot `.8` was
  opened to end (*the flow had been fixed with checks that could themselves rot*).
- ⚠️ State the residual honestly: hook-bypassable + machine-local unless a CI lane re-proves it.
  ⛔ Price before mechanizing (`GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.4`'s rule).

## Current Frontier

`.1` — the audit. ⭐ But the tree's PURPOSE is `.4`: the flow guaranteeing the bar. `.1`-`.3` exist to make `.4` possible.

## Blockers

`.1` is read-only and can start immediately. ⛔ **`.4` — the guarantee itself — is BLOCKED on `CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT.7` (aggregate green) and on the escalated director call about resuming hosted auto-triggers.**
