# CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT: the local CI-parity gate — the one the README names as the way to prove workflow parity while hosted Actions are paused — has not been able to complete for 1,371 commits

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT`
- Status: `active` (opened 2026-07-27, session #215)
- Family / slice-id prefix: `PGEN-CI-PARITY-GATE-ROT-<NNNN>`
- Created: `2026-07-27`
- Owner: repo-local workflow
- **Frontier: `.1`** (adjudicate the 8 failing audits — audit stale, or repo wrong?)
- Opened by: `GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.3`, which had to run
  `make -C rust SHELL=/bin/bash ci_workflow_local_gate` in order to register a new surface
  audit, and found the gate dies on its **first** audit. Deliberately NOT absorbed into that
  leaf: the residual failures are eight independent defect classes (docs-surface drift, a
  stale API-version pin, superseded contract prose, a Perl-reference rule) with nothing in
  common but the gate they live in.

## ⭐ THE FINDING (measured, at commit `730419a2`)

`make -C rust SHELL=/bin/bash ci_workflow_local_gate` is the repo's **local workflow-parity
gate**. `README.md` names it explicitly as the lane to use *while hosted GitHub Actions are
paused to conserve account minutes* ("routine proof should use the local `make -C rust ...`
gates until hosted auto-runs are re-enabled"). It is also the gate that audits the root /
top-level / contract / reference markdown allowlists and replays the tracked workflow
commands.

**It cannot complete, and has not been able to for 1,371 commits.**

### The first blocker (repaired by `GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.3`, not by this tree)

`audit_static_include_paths` — the **first** audit `main()` calls — asserted
`assert_tracked "generated/ebnf.rs"`. Nothing under `generated/` is tracked:

```
$ git ls-files generated/ | wc -l
0
$ grep -n 'generated/' .gitignore
24:generated/
```

Commit `0ed2b2ad` *"Slice 5: stop tracking generated/\* in git"* (2026-04-29) is an ancestor
of `HEAD`, with **1,371 commits since**. Seven `assert_tracked "generated/…"` call sites were
asserting a condition repository policy guarantees can never hold. `GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.3`
repaired them (new helper `assert_generated_artifact`, which checks *presence on disk* — the
condition `rust/build.rs` actually tests with `is_file()` — and refuses with the regeneration
command), because otherwise that leaf's own newly-registered audit would have been
unreachable dead code.

### What remains: 8 of 31 audit functions still fail, each independently

Measured after the repair, by sourcing the gate and invoking every `audit_*` function in its
own subshell:

| # | failing audit | measured reason |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `audit_top_level_docs_surface` | allowlist omits 4 live files: `docs/TASK_TREE.md`, `docs/TASK_TREE_README.md`, `docs/POST_SV_AUDIT_LEDGER.md`, `docs/SV_EXH_PROOF_BASELINE.md` |
| 2 | `audit_contract_docs_surface` | `contract docs allowlist drift detected` |
| 3 | `audit_reference_docs_surface` | `reference docs allowlist drift detected` |
| 4 | `audit_active_docs_rehome_paths` | live docs still cite pre-rehome paths |
| 5 | `audit_embedding_api_surface` | pins `pub const EMBEDDING_API_VERSION: &str = "1.2.0";`; the source has moved on |
| 6 | `audit_ebnf_frontend_conversion_surface` | forbids `ebnf_to_json.pl` in `rust/Makefile` — it is present |
| 7 | `audit_rtl_frontend_generated_contract_surface` | expects `expected_rule_texts` in the probe; superseded by the `0.2.0` typed-AST contract migration |
| 8 | `audit_sv_formal_exhaustive_closure_surface` | pins contract prose (`required_surface_missing_detail`) that has since changed |

⚠️ **None of these is a one-line fix, and none should be "made green" reflexively.** Each is
the same question with a different answer: **is the AUDIT stale, or is the REPO wrong?**
Rows 1–4 look like genuine allowlist drift the audits exist to catch — in which case the
finding is that four live docs were added without the deliberate policy update the audit
demands, and the gate was right. Rows 5–8 look like audits pinned to superseded content by
campaigns that moved on without updating them — in which case the audits are the stale party.
Guessing wrong in either direction silently destroys a real check.

## ⭐⭐ WHY THIS MATTERS MORE THAN ITS SIZE SUGGESTS

This is the **third** instance in two sessions of a maintained check that nothing runs, and
the pattern is now unmistakable:

1. `GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.1` — `make -C rust ast_dump_contract_gate` RED since
   `7219547c`; *"referenced by no aggregate and no CI workflow"*.
2. `GENERATED-LINT-CORRECTNESS.3` — `PGEN_CLIPPY_GENERATED_STRICT` set by nothing at all; the
   291 → 0 win was unguarded from the moment it landed.
3. **This tree** — the local parity gate itself, which is the *designated substitute* for the
   paused hosted workflows.

⇒ the unifying principle this family keeps re-deriving — **a check that cannot run, or cannot
see, must SAY SO, not return green** — has a corollary that is not yet mechanized:
**a check that nothing INVOKES is indistinguishable from a check that does not exist.** The
project has no inventory answering *"which tracked gates are reachable from something that
actually runs?"* That question is `.2`.

## Leaves

### `.1` — adjudicate the 8 failing audits (`todo`)

- **Status: `todo`** — frontier.
- For each of the 8 rows above, decide **audit-stale** vs **repo-wrong**, with evidence, and
  fix the correct side. Expect a mix; do not batch them into one verdict.
- ⛔ Explicitly forbidden: deleting or relaxing an audit to make the gate green. Rows 1–4 in
  particular exist to stop exactly the drift they are reporting.
- Acceptance: `make -C rust SHELL=/bin/bash ci_workflow_local_gate` completes its audit phase,
  with each of the 8 dispositions recorded and justified in this leaf.
- ⚠️ Note for whoever runs this: the audits inspect the REAL repo (`$ROOT_DIR`), while
  `run_workflow` executes inside the exported tracked-only worktree. The two halves have
  different visibility, and that asymmetry is load-bearing — `generated/` exists for the
  former and never for the latter.

### `.2` — a reachability inventory: which tracked gates does anything actually invoke? (`todo`)

- **Status: `todo`**.
- Build the missing inventory: for every `make` gate target and every tracked
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, record whether it is reachable from `sota_exit_gate`,
  `ci_workflow_local_gate`, the commit workflow, or a CI workflow — and flag the orphans.
- Three orphans are already known and were each found by accident, one per session:
  `ast_dump_contract_gate`, the generated-clippy strict stage, and `ci_workflow_local_gate`'s
  own audit phase. **Finding them by accident is the defect**; the inventory is the fix.
- Consider promoting the inventory to an enforced doctrine in `scripts/check_doctrines.sh`
  (a new tracked gate that belongs to no aggregate and no workflow is a commit-time warning),
  so the class closes rather than recurring a fourth time.

## Evidence

- Measured at commit `730419a2`, session #215. The census was produced by sourcing
  `rust/scripts/ci_workflow_local_gate.sh` with its trailing `main "$@"` stripped and invoking
  each `audit_*` function in its own subshell — 31 functions total, 8 failing after the
  `assert_generated_artifact` repair.
- Provenance of the first blocker: `git log -1 --format="%h %ad %s" --date=short 0ed2b2ad` →
  `0ed2b2ad 2026-04-29 Slice 5: stop tracking generated/* in git`;
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor 0ed2b2ad HEAD` → true;
  `git rev-list --count 0ed2b2ad..HEAD` → `1371`.
