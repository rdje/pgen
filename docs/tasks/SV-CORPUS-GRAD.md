# SV-CORPUS-GRAD: graduate the SV parser from the external official / recognized SV test corpora (verible, slang, sv-tests, verilator, …) — the SECOND mandatory axis of the SV `Done` bar

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `SV-CORPUS-GRAD`
- Status: **`active`** (created 2026-07-22, session #190, on the director's
  bar-amending directive — verbatim: "AS part of th SV Done campaign we should
  include the external official and recognized SV test corpus (verible, slang,
  ...). The SV parser shall cleanly pass all of them with flying colors. No Done
  with the SV parser graduating from those external official and recognized SV
  corpus." — [[project_sv_done_requires_external_corpus_graduation]])
- Roadmap lane: the **Nexsim delivery directive**
  ([[project_nexsim_sv_signoff_delivery_focus]]) + the locked program. Sibling of
  `SV-REPLAY-DEBT` (axis 1: the family-status gate's last criterion); this tree
  owns axis 2. BOTH must be green before the SV family row flips `Done`.
- Created: `2026-07-22`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## ⭐ The corpora ALREADY EXIST — this tree builds on them, it does NOT re-acquire

Director-prompted extensive sweep (2026-07-22) re-surfaced the full prior
capture. The acquisition + first characterization were **done 2026-06-17** by
`EXTERNAL-CORPUS.3.1` (`PGEN-EXTERNAL-CORPUS-0007`):

- **Vendored suites** (git submodules, pinned, sparse/shallow to test dirs,
  licenses flagged in `stimuli/sv/subs/PROVENANCE.md`; director 2026-06-17:
  GPL-OK for test-input use, copyleft flagged):
  - `stimuli/sv/subs/sv-tests` — `25e4d275`, ISC, `tests/`, 1028 files, per-file
    `:should_fail_because:`/`:tags:` metadata — THE canonical conformance corpus;
  - `stimuli/sv/subs/verible` — `a0a8d8eb`, Apache-2.0, `verible/verilog/`, 152;
  - `stimuli/sv/subs/slang` — `4106501b`, MIT, `tests/`, 92;
  - `stimuli/sv/subs/verilator` — `a534a1d1`, ⚠️ LGPL-3.0/Artistic-2.0,
    `test_regress/`, ~3263 (the largest practical SV corpus);
  - plus the pre-existing real-design corpora `Cores-VeeR-EL2` / `scr1` /
    `friscv` (multi-file designs needing include/lib chaining; they feed the
    curated `sv_external_corpus_triage_gate`, 14/14 green) and `stimuli/sv/uvm`.
- **Runner**: `stimuli/run_external_corpus.sh sv` (per-file
  `parseability_probe --parse systemverilog --profile sv_2017`, parallel,
  timeout-bounded; re-acquire recipe in PROVENANCE).
- **Baseline characterization** (2026-06-17 vintage, ~25 SV releases stale):
  `stimuli/sv/characterization/characterization.md` + `results.tsv` —
  **5128 files: 2975 pass (58.0%) / 2151 fail / 2 timeout**; per suite:
  sv-tests 76.9%, verible 78.9%, slang 77.2%, verilator 59.4%; the full-design
  corpora read low (friscv 7% / scr1 14% / VeeR 16.7%) because the bulk runner
  parses files in ISOLATION without the preprocessing/include chaining the
  curated 14/14 triage gate does perform.
- **Canonical repo/roster reference**:
  `docs/decisions/reference_sv_external_corpus_and_oracle_repos.md`
  (+ KM card) — the recognized corpus/oracle list (director 2026-06-09).
- **The binding 2026-06-17 director cross-lane sequencing**
  (`GRAMMAR-WELLFORMED.md` history): **(1)** SV `UNKNOWN→0` — ✅ **DONE
  2026-07-22** (`STRUCTURED-WITNESS-SYNTH`, SV recognized `fully_certified`);
  **(2)** the `H.12.5.8` infix property/sequence binary-operator parse bug —
  **OPEN** (`.8.1` WHY+WHERE done, `.8.2` fix-design pending); **(3)** THEN the
  full external-corpus gap-drive. This directive ACTIVATES lane 3 as an
  in-campaign mandate; lane 2 is a known top burn-down item inside it.
- Boundary kept: **PARSE-COMPLETENESS** retains the differential-ORACLE lane
  (building slang/verible as reference binaries — still director-gated); this
  tree needs only the corpora + their own answer keys, no tool builds. The
  parked `REJECTS-VALID-DEFENSE` SV clause is superseded-by-GO here.

## Goal (the tree's single deliverable)

The SV parser **graduates** from the vendored recognized corpora: every case
carries a **spec/metadata-derived expected verdict** (accept-valid /
reject-invalid / out-of-scope-with-named-cause), the parser matches every
expected verdict — **zero unexplained divergences** — proven by a standing
deterministic **graduation gate** wired into the SV family-status `Done`
computation as its 8th criterion. Exclusions named, justified, tracked; never
gamed ([[feedback_corpus_expected_from_spec_not_fix]]).

## Ground rules

- **Characterize FIRST, fix SECOND**: measurement passes never masquerade as
  fixes; each defect class then gets its own tool-diagnosed burn-down leaf (fix
  hierarchy: annotations > store > grammar > engine; TOOLBOX checklist on every
  landing leaf; releases bumped per policy).
- A corpus fail is NOT automatically a parser bug: sv-tests
  `:should_fail_because:` negatives, verilator expected-fail regressions, and
  intentionally-invalid fixtures make parse-FAIL the CORRECT verdict — the
  adjudication manifest is what turns raw pass-rates into a defect signal.
- **Preprocessing**: full-design corpora (and many suite cases) require
  `\`define`/`\`include` chaining — route through the triage-manifest
  `bootstrap_files` convention (the 14/14 uvm precedent); where true macro
  EXPANSION is required, adjudicate against the `SVPP-EXPANSION` dependency
  with a named cause, never a silent exclusion.
- **Heavy runs** under `scripts/run_with_memory_guard.sh --budget-mb 16384`;
  known-pathological inputs excluded up front and tracked
  ([[feedback_dont_run_jobs_that_hit_known_pathological_inputs]]).

## Leaves

### `.1` — Re-characterize at TODAY's vintage + adjudication design (read-only + docs)

- **Status: `todo`** — the 2026-06-17 baseline is ~25 SV releases stale
  (LRM-bracket/`$`-anchor/covergroup/bind restorations, `verilog_2005` gating,
  the `.37.x` uvm arc all landed since). Re-run
  `stimuli/run_external_corpus.sh sv` guarded at HEAD vintage → the fresh
  per-suite pass/fail baseline. DESIGN the adjudication: per-suite expected-
  verdict derivation (sv-tests `:should_fail_because:`/`:tags:`; verilator
  `test_regress` expected-fail conventions; slang/verible fixture semantics),
  the verdict taxonomy, and the manifest format. Adjudicate whether the roster
  needs additions (the directive's "…") — candidates from the reference record
  (ivtest, yosys tests, UHDM samples) — additions are their own acquisition
  leaf if adopted.

### `.2` — The adjudication manifest + the honest divergence baseline

- **Status: `todo`** — build the expected-vs-actual manifest over every vendored
  case per `.1`'s design; the output number (unexplained divergences, by defect
  class) is the campaign's burn-down baseline. Suite metadata is the answer key;
  LRM grounding where metadata is absent.

### `.3` — Defect burn-down (umbrella; one leaf per defect class)

- **Status: `todo`** — scoped from `.2`'s taxonomy. **First known member:
  `GRAMMAR-WELLFORMED.H.12.5.8`** (the infix property/sequence binary-operator
  parse bug — `a ##1 b` / `a or b` / `a and b` / `until`-family / `intersect` /
  `within` ALL reject; WHY+WHERE done, fix-design pending; stays owned by its
  tree, cross-linked here as a graduation blocker). NOTE the convergence: the
  `SV-REPLAY-DEBT` dominant residual cluster (`prop_primary_*` /
  `concurrent_assertion_*` / sequence rules) lives in the SAME grammar region —
  fixing the infix lane likely moves BOTH axes.

### `.4` — Full-design corpora chaining

- **Status: `todo`** — extend the curated chaining (bootstrap_files) so
  friscv/scr1/VeeR adjudicate file-by-file honestly or as chained units;
  expansion-dependent cases classified with cause against `SVPP-EXPANSION`.

### `.5` — The standing graduation gate + family-status wiring (code)

- **Status: `todo`** — a deterministic `make` gate asserting zero unexplained
  divergences over the vendored suites at pinned commits; wired as the 8th
  `sv_parser_family_status_gate` criterion (`external_corpus_graduation_green`)
  so `Done` is machine-computed over BOTH axes.

### `.6` — Done-flip lockstep

- **Status: `todo`** — LIVE tracker / SV parser book / SV integration contract /
  top-level book corpus chapter; the SV row flips `Done` ONLY when axis 1
  (`SV-REPLAY-DEBT`) and axis 2 (this tree) are both green.

## Acceptance Criteria (tree)

1. Fresh characterization at HEAD vintage + a complete adjudication manifest:
   every vendored case classified with a metadata/spec-derived expected verdict.
2. The parser matches ALL expected verdicts; exclusions named + justified in the
   tracked manifest; **zero unexplained divergences** ("flying colors", earned).
3. The graduation gate is standing, deterministic (pinned corpus commits), and
   wired into the SV family-status `Done` computation.
4. Full lockstep (books/LIVE/contract) and every landing leaf through the
   TOOLBOX acceptance checklist.
