# Stimuli and Quality

The stimuli system is one of PGEN's defining features.

## Why It Matters

PGEN is not satisfied with "the parser compiles." It aims for:

- grammar-aware stimuli generation,
- parseability-aware generation,
- target-driven replay,
- coverage and gap analysis,
- promotion and counterexample retention,
- cross-family quality proof.

## Current Stimuli Doctrine

The live direction for stimuli work now includes the first five planned upgrades in bounded initial form:

1. grammar-aware mutation
2. constrained-random steering
3. stronger near-valid negative generation
4. corpus export / promotion groundwork
5. smarter shrinkers, starting with delimiter-aware structural minimization

The shrinker work is deliberately not complete yet. The first landed slice teaches the existing counterexample minimizer to try balanced `()`, `[]`, and `{}` reductions before and after generic chunk minimization. Future work should push deeper into grammar-tree-aware shrinkers that can drop optional nodes, collapse alternations, reduce repetitions, and prune subtrees while preserving the failing property.

## Cross-Family Rule

Major stimuli-generator upgrades should prove themselves on at least:

- `regex`
- `vhdl`
- `systemverilog`

That rule keeps stimuli work platform-grade instead of grammar-specific.

## Key Quality Lanes

- `stimuli_cross_family_platform_gate`
- family-specific quality gates
- parseability reports and target-driven replay
- bounded contract files and summary artifacts

## Probe-Only Steering

When a family is down to a stubborn replay frontier, PGEN now distinguishes between two kinds of literal steering:

- `@sample` for ordinary always-on literalish steering
- `@probe_sample` for active-entry-only target-drive replay

That split matters because a hint that is useful when probing a single dependency rule can be harmful if it fires everywhere during normal top-level generation. The current maintained rule is:

- use `@sample` when the grammar really should always short-circuit to that literal shape
- use `@probe_sample` when the literal is meant to accelerate targeted replay of a specific rule without flattening ordinary coverage

## Replay Progress Tracing

The heavy replay gates are intentionally quiet by default, but the retained SystemVerilog replay lane now has an opt-in progress surface when a closed-loop stage is CPU-hot and needs inspection.

- `rust/scripts/sv_stimuli_quality_gate.sh` accepts `PGEN_SV_STIMULI_QUALITY_REPLAY_TRACE_VERBOSITY`
- keep the default at `none` for ordinary runs
- use `low` when you want replay-stage start/progress/completion lines from the Rust target-drive loop without turning the whole gate into an always-on debug dump
- low trace now also surfaces:
  - immediate helper-probe activation lines when replay switches away from the primary entry rule
  - helper-probe result lines showing pending-target payoff after each helper attempt

That trace is meant for honest progress visibility during stubborn replay work, not as a replacement for the gate's final summary artifacts.

PGEN now also lets the replay selector learn a little within a single target-drive run. If a helper rule has already retired meaningful target debt earlier in that same run, later probe selection can treat that observed payoff as part of the ranking signal instead of relying only on static dependency heuristics. This is intentionally bounded to the current replay session; it is replay-local guidance, not a persisted cross-run learning system.

Low replay trace now also exposes the helper competition directly. At each helper activation, PGEN can show the selected helper pool plus the top dependency and pending candidates. That makes replay tuning less mystical: you can see whether a stubborn lane is dominated by one stable pending frontier or by rapidly changing dependency probes.

That same comparison now influences selection in one bounded way. PGEN no longer treats the mere existence of a dependency candidate as an absolute trump card. If the top dependency is only a fresh marginal probe while the top pending rule still carries a much broader untouched frontier, the pending helper can be selected instead. This is deliberate replay steering, not a claim that pending rules are always better; the tradeoff is that these broader pending probes can be much slower once they begin running.

PGEN now stages that broader pending-frontier escape hatch too. In the maintained cheap replay lane, the pending frontier is only allowed to outrank dependency churn after replay has already stayed stagnant beyond the ordinary helper threshold for a little longer. Low trace exposes that state explicitly as `pending_frontier_unlocked=true|false`, and now also reports the effective unlock threshold plus the configured extra stagnation budget, so users can tell whether a replay stayed in its cheap dependency-first budget or crossed into a heavier pending-frontier regime.

That heavier regime is now a deliberate control surface instead of a hidden constant. `ast_pipeline` exposes `--target-pending-frontier-extra-stagnation`, the maintained default stays at `8`, and the SystemVerilog quality gate can override the same behavior with `PGEN_SV_STIMULI_QUALITY_PENDING_FRONTIER_EXTRA_STAGNATION` for focused proof runs. Stimuli corpus bundle metadata records the configured value too, so replay posture stays auditable after the fact.

The first focused main-SystemVerilog measurement also clarified how that control should be used. Setting the extra stagnation budget to `0` does unlock the heavy lane immediately and can flip the second helper from dependency churn to the broad pending frontier `property_expr_sv_2017`, but the same run became dramatically slower and was still active after more than three minutes of wall clock without finishing the retained 128-attempt probe. So the maintained documentation stance is simple: keep `8` as the default proof posture and treat `0` as an experiment knob, not the ordinary lane.

PGEN now pairs that heavier knob with an explicit safety rail too. `ast_pipeline` exposes `--target-helper-generation-timeout-ms`, the maintained default is `1000`, `0` disables the helper timeout, and the SystemVerilog quality gate can override the same behavior with `PGEN_SV_STIMULI_QUALITY_TARGET_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS`. That timeout applies only to alternate helper-entry probes, not to ordinary primary-entry generation.

That follow-up changed the heavy-lane story in an important way. Reusing the same focused `sv_2017` immediate-unlock repro, the run that previously stalled now completes the full retained 128-attempt probe at `970/2593` resolved with `7` bounded helper timeouts on `property_expr_sv_2017`. So the doctrine remains: `8` is still the maintained default posture, but immediate unlock is no longer operationally hostile in the same way because broad helper probes are now effort-bounded.

PGEN now also surfaces those bounded failures directly in the replay-facing artifacts. Target-driven summaries report `helper_timeout_errors`, validator-backed parseability reports preserve the same counter inside `target_drive_validation`, and stimuli corpus bundles retain it too. That means a future replay investigation can distinguish "generic generation error" from "helper budget fired" without scraping low trace by hand.
