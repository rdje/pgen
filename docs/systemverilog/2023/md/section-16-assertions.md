16. Assertions
### 16.1 General

This clause describes the following:
—
Immediate assertions
—
Concurrent assertions
—
Sequence specifications
—
Property specifications
### 16.2 Overview

An assertion specifies a behavior of the system. Assertions are primarily used to validate the behavior of a
design. In addition, assertions can be used to provide functional coverage and to flag that input stimulus,
which is used for validation, does not conform to assumed requirements.
An assertion appears as an assertion statement that states the verification function to be performed. The
statement shall be of one of the following kinds:
—
assert, to specify the property as an obligation for the design that is to be checked to verify that the
property holds.
—
assume, to specify the property as an assumption for the environment. Simulators check that the
property holds, while formal tools use the information to generate input stimulus.
—
cover, to monitor the property evaluation for coverage.
—
restrict, to specify the property as a constraint on formal verification computations. Simulators
do not check the property.
There are two kinds of assertions: concurrent and immediate.
—
Immediate assertions follow simulation event semantics for their execution and are executed like a
statement in a procedural block. Immediate assertions are primarily intended to be used with
simulation. There is no immediate restrict assertion statement.
—
Concurrent assertions are based on clock semantics and use sampled values of their expressions (see
16.5.1). One of the goals of SystemVerilog assertions is to provide a common semantic meaning for
assertions so that they can be used to drive various design and verification tools. Many tools, such as
formal verification tools, evaluate circuit descriptions using cycle-based semantics, which typically
rely on a clock signal or signals to drive the evaluation of the circuit. Any timing or event behavior
between clock edges is abstracted away. Concurrent assertions incorporate this clock semantics.
While this approach generally simplifies the evaluation of a circuit description, there are a number
of scenarios under which this cycle-based evaluation provides different behavior from the standard
event-based evaluation of SystemVerilog.
This clause describes both types of assertions.
### 16.3 Immediate assertions

The immediate assertion statement is a test of an expression performed when the statement is executed in the
procedural code. The expression is nontemporal and is interpreted the same way as an expression in the
condition of a procedural if statement. In other words, if the expression evaluates to x, z, or 0, then it is
interpreted as being false, and the assertion statement is said to fail. Otherwise, the expression is interpreted
as being true, and the assertion statement is said to pass or, equivalently, to succeed.

There are two modes of immediate assertions, simple immediate assertions and deferred immediate
assertions. In a simple immediate assertion, pass and fail actions take place immediately upon assertion
evaluation. In a deferred immediate assertion, the actions are delayed until later in the time step, providing
some level of protection against unintended multiple executions on transient or “glitch” values. Deferred
immediate assertions are described in detail in 16.4.
The immediate_assertion_statement is a statement_item and can be specified anywhere a procedural
statement is specified. The execution of immediate assertions can be controlled by using assertion control
system tasks (see 20.11).

The immediate assert statement specifies that its expression is required to hold. Failure of an immediate
assert statement indicates a violation of the requirement and thus a potential error in the design.
The immediate assume statement specifies that its expression is assumed to hold. For example, immediate
assume statements can be used with formal verification tools to specify assumptions on design inputs that
constrain the verification computation. When used in this way, they specify the expected behavior of the
environment of the design as opposed to that of the design itself. A simulation tool shall provide the
capability to treat an immediate assume statement as an immediate assert statement in order to verify that
the environment behaves as assumed.
The action_block of an immediate assert or assume statement specifies what actions are taken upon
success or failure of the assertion. The statement associated with success is the first statement. It is called the
pass statement and shall be executed if the expression evaluates to true. The pass statement can, for
example, record the number of successes for a coverage log, but can be omitted altogether. If the pass
statement is omitted, then no user-specified action is taken when the assert expression of the immediate
assert or assume statement is true. The statement associated with else is called the fail statement and
shall be executed if the expression evaluates to false. The else clause can also be omitted entirely. In that
case, the tool shall, by default, call $error, unless $assertcontrol is used to suppress the failure (see
20.11). The action_block shall be enabled to execute immediately after the evaluation of the assert
expression of the immediate assert or assume statement. The execution of pass and fail statements can be
controlled by using assertion action control tasks. The assertion action control tasks are described in 20.11.
The immediate cover statement specifies that successful evaluation of its expression is a coverage goal.
Tools shall collect coverage information and report the results at the end of simulation or on demand via an
assertion API (see Clause 39). The results of coverage for an immediate cover statement shall contain the
following:
—
Number of times evaluated
—
Number of times succeeded
A pass statement for an immediate cover may be specified in statement_or_null. The pass statement shall
be executed if the expression evaluates to true. The pass statement shall be enabled to execute immediately
after the evaluation of the expression of the immediate cover.
The optional statement label (identifier and colon) creates a named block around the assertion statement (or
any other statement), and the hierarchical name of the scope can be displayed using the %m format
specification.
The information about assertion failure can be printed using one of the severity system tasks in the action
block, as described in 20.10.
The severity system tasks can be used in assertion pass or fail statements. These tasks shall print the same
tool-specific message when used either in a pass or a fail statement. For example:
assert_f: assert(f) $info("passed"); else $error("failed");
assume_inputs: assume (in_a || in_b) $info("assumption holds");
else $error("assumption does not hold");
cover_a_and_b: cover (in_a && in_b) $info("in_a && in_b == 1 covered");
For example, a formal verification tool might prove assert_f under the assumption assume_inputs
expressing the condition that in_a and in_b are not both 0 at the same time. The cover statement detects
whether in_a and in_b are both simultaneously 1.

If more than one of these system tasks is included in the action block, then each shall be executed as
specified.
If the severity system task is executed at a time other than when the immediate assert or assume fails, the
actual failure time of the immediate assert or assume can be recorded and displayed programmatically.
For example:
time t;
always @(posedge clk)
if (state == REQ)
assert (req1 || req2)
else begin
t = $time;
#5 $error("assert failed at time %0t",t);
end
If the immediate assert fails at time 10, the error message shall be printed at time 15, but the user-defined
string printed will be “assert failed at time 10.”
Because the fail statement, like the pass statement, is any legal SystemVerilog procedural statement, it can
also be used to signal a failure to another part of the testbench.
assert (myfunc(a,b)) count1 = count + 1; else ->event1;
assert (y == 0) else flag = 1;

Syntax 16-2—Deferred immediate assertion syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
Deferred assertions are a kind of immediate assertion. They can be used to suppress false reports that occur
due to glitching activity on combinational inputs to immediate assertions. Since deferred assertions are a
subset of immediate assertions, the term deferred assertion (often used for brevity) is equivalent to the term

deferred immediate assertion. The term simple immediate assertion refers to an immediate assertion that is
not deferred. In addition, there are two different kinds of deferred assertions: observed deferred immediate
assertions and final deferred immediate assertions.
A deferred assertion is similar to a simple immediate assertion, but with the following key differences:
—
Syntax: Deferred assertions use #0 (for an observed deferred assertion) or final (for a final
deferred assertion) after the verification directive.
—
Deferral: Reporting is delayed rather than being reported immediately.
—
Action block limitations: Action blocks may only contain a single subroutine call.
—
Use outside procedures: A deferred assertion may be used as a module_common_item.
Deferred assertion syntax is similar to simple immediate assertion syntax, with the difference being the
specification of a #0 or final after the assert, assume, or cover:
assert #0 (expression) action_block
assert final (expression) action_block
As with all immediate assertions, a deferred assertion’s expression is evaluated at the time the deferred
assertion statement is processed. However, in order to facilitate glitch avoidance, the reporting or action
blocks are scheduled at a later point in the current time step.
The pass and fail statements in a deferred assertion’s action_block, if present, shall each consist of a single
subroutine call. The subroutine can be a task, task method, void function, void function method, or system
task. The requirement of a single subroutine call implies that no begin-end block shall surround the pass or
fail statements, as begin is itself a statement that is not a subroutine call. In the case of a final deferred
assertion, the subroutine shall be one that may be legally called in the Postponed region (see 4.4.2.9). A
subroutine argument may be passed by value as an input or passed by reference as a ref or const ref.
Actual argument expressions that are passed by value, including function calls, shall be fully evaluated at the
instant the deferred assertion expression is evaluated. It shall be an error to pass automatic or dynamic
variables as actuals to a ref or const ref formal. The processing of the action_block differs between
observed and final deferred assertions as follows:
—
For an observed deferred assertion, the subroutine shall be scheduled in the Reactive region. Actual
argument expressions that are passed by reference use or assign the current values of the underlying
variables in the Reactive region.
—
For a final deferred assertion, the subroutine shall be scheduled in the Postponed region. Actual
argument expressions that are passed by reference use the current values of the underlying variables
in the Postponed region.
Deferred assertions may also be used outside procedural code, as a module_common_item. This is explained
in more detail in 16.4.3.
In addition to deferred assert statements, deferred assume and cover statements are also defined. Other
than the deferred evaluation as described in this subclause, these assume and cover statements behave the
same way as the simple immediate assume and cover statements described in 16.3. A deferred assume
will often be useful in cases where a combinational condition is checked in a function, but needs to be used
as an assumption rather than a proof target by formal tools. A deferred cover is useful to avoid crediting
tests for covering a condition that is only met in passing by glitched values.
#### 16.4.1 Deferred assertion reporting

When a deferred assertion passes or fails, the action block is not executed immediately. Instead, the action
block subroutine call (or $error, if an assert or assume fails and no else clause is present) and the

current values of its input arguments are placed in a deferred assertion report queue associated with the
currently executing process. Such a call is said to be a pending assertion report.
If a deferred assertion flush point (see 16.4.2) is reached in a process, its deferred assertion report queue is
cleared. Any pending assertion reports will not be executed.
In the Observed region of each simulation time step, each pending observed deferred assertion report that
has not been flushed from its queue shall mature, or be confirmed for reporting. Once a report matures, it
may no longer be flushed. Then the associated subroutine call (or $error, if the assertion fails and no else
clause is present) is executed in the Reactive region, and the pending assertion report is cleared from the
appropriate process’s deferred assertion report queue.
Note that if code in the Reactive region modifies signals and causes another pass to the Active region to
occur, this still may create glitching behavior in observed deferred assertions, as the new passage in the
Active region may re-execute some of the deferred assertions with different reported results. In general,
observed deferred assertions prevent glitches due to order of procedural execution, but do not prevent
glitches caused by execution loops between regions that the assignments from the Reactive region may
cause.
In the Postponed region of each simulation time step, each pending final deferred assertion report that has
not been flushed from its queue shall mature. Then the associated subroutine call (or $error, if the assertion
fails and no else clause is present) is scheduled in the same Postponed region, and the pending assertion
report is cleared from the appropriate process’s deferred assertion report queue. Due to their execution in the
non-iterative Postponed region, final deferred assertions are not vulnerable to the potential glitch behavior
previously described for observed deferred assertions.
#### 16.4.2 Deferred assertion flush points

A process is defined to have reached a deferred assertion flush point if any of the following occur:
—
The process, having been suspended earlier due to reaching an event control or wait statement,
resumes execution.
—
The process was declared by an always_comb or always_latch, and its execution is resumed due
to a transition on one of its dependent signals.
—
The outermost scope of the process is disabled by a disable statement (see 16.4.4)
The following example shows how deferred assertions might be used to avoid undesired reports of a failure
due to transitional combinational values in a single simulation time step:
assign not_a = !a;
always_comb begin : b1
a1: assert (not_a != a);
a2: assert #0 (not_a != a); // Should pass once values have settled
end
When a changes, a simulator could evaluate assertions a1 and a2 twice—once for the change in a and once
for the change in not_a after the evaluation of the continuous assignment. A failure could thus be reported
during the first execution of a1. The failure during the first execution of a2 will be scheduled on the
process’s deferred assertion report queue. When not_a changes, the deferred assertion queue is flushed due
to the activation of b1, so no failure of a2 will be reported.
This example illustrates the behavior of deferred assertions in the presence of time delays:
always @(a or b) begin : b1
a3: assert #0 (a == b) rptobj.success(0); else rptobj.error(0, a, b);

#1;
a4: assert #0 (a == b) rptobj.success(1); else rptobj.error(1, a, b);
end
In this case, due to the time delay in the middle of the procedure, an Observed region will always be reached
after the execution of a3 and before a flush point. Thus any passes or failures of a3 will always be reported.
For a4, during cycles where either a or b changes after it has been executed, failures will be flushed and
never reported. In general, deferred assertions need to be used carefully when mixed with time delays.
The following example illustrates a typical use of a deferred cover statement:
assign a = ...;
assign b = ...;
always_comb begin : b1
c1: cover (b != a);
c2: cover #0 (b != a);
end
In this example, it is important to make sure some test is covering the case where a and b have different
values. Due to the arbitrary order of the assignments in the simulator, it might be the case that in a cycle
where both variables are being assigned the same value, b1 executes while a has been assigned but b still
holds its previous value. Thus c1 will be triggered, but this is actually a glitch, and probably not a useful
piece of coverage information. In the case of c2, this coverage will get added to the deferred report queue,
but when b1 is executed the next time (after b has also been assigned its new value), that coverage point will
be flushed, and c2 will correctly not get reported as having been covered during that time step.
The next example illustrates a case where, due to short-circuiting (see 11.3.5), the result of a deferred
assertion may not appear at first glance to be consistent with the signal values at the end of a time step.
function f(bit v);
p: assert #0 (v);
...
endfunction
always_comb begin: myblk
a = b || f(c);
end
Suppose, during some time step, the following sequence of events occurs:
—
b is set to 0 while c==1, and myblk is entered. When f is called, assertion p has a passing value.
—
Later in the time step b settles at a value of 1, while c becomes 0. When the procedure resumes, the
previous execution is flushed. This time, due to short-circuiting, f is never evaluated—so the new
failing value of assertion p is never seen.
—
In the Reactive region, no passing or failing execution is reported by the simulator on p.
NOTE—If the bitwise | operator, which does not allow short-circuiting, were used instead of || in the assignment to a,
then f would be evaluated each time the assignment was reached.
The following example illustrates the evaluation of subroutine arguments to deferred assertion action
blocks.
function int error_type (int opcode);
func_assert: assert (opcode < 64) else $display("Opcode error.");
if (opcode < 32)
return (0);
else
return (1);

endfunction
always_comb begin : b1
a1: assert #0 (my_cond) else
$error("Error on operation of type %d\n", error_type(opcode));
a2: assert #0 (my_cond) else
error_type(opcode);
...
end
Suppose block b1 is executed twice in the Active region of a single time step, with my_cond == 0, so it
fails assertions a1 and a2 both times. Also suppose opcode is 64 the first time it is executed, and 0 the
second time. The following will occur during simulation:
—
Upon each deferred assertion failure, the subroutine arguments of the action block are evaluated,
even though the action block itself is not executed.
•
Upon the first failure of a1, the arguments of $error are examined. Since the second argument
contains a function call, that function (error_type(opcode), with opcode=64) is evaluated.
During this function call, func_assert fails and displays the message “Opcode error.”
•
Upon the first failure of a2, the arguments of error_type are examined. Since its only
argument is the expression opcode, its value 64 is used and no further evaluation is needed at
this time.
•
The pending reports with opcode=64 are placed on the deferred assertion report queue.
—
When block b1 is executed again, the pending reports are flushed from the deferred assertion report
queue.
•
Upon the second failure of a1, function error_type is called with opcode==0, so assertion
func_assert passes.
•
Upon the second failure of a2, the value of 0 is used for the expression opcode, and no further
evaluation is needed at this time.
—
When the assertions later mature, the $error severity system task will be called for a1, and the
function error_type will be called for a2.
The deferral and flushing prevented a report from the first failure of a1 as expected. But the evaluation of
action block subroutine arguments, which happens every time a pending assertion report is queued, caused a
function to be called upon each failure. In general, users need to be cautious about the contents of action
blocks for deferred assertions, since the evaluation of their subroutine arguments on every failure may seem
inconsistent with the deferral in some usages.
The following example illustrates the differences between observed deferred assertions and final deferred
assertions.
module dut(input logic clk, input logic a, input logic b);
logic c;
always_ff @(posedge clk)
c <= b;
a1: assert #0 (!(a & c)) $display("Pass"); else $display("Fail");
a2: assert final (!(a & c)) $display("Pass"); else $display("Fail");
endmodule
program tb(input logic clk, output logic a, output logic b);
default clocking m @(posedge clk);
default input #0;
default output #0;
output a;
output b;

endclocking
initial begin
a = 1;
b = 0;
##10;
b = 1;
##1;
a = 0;
end
endprogram
module sva_svtb;
bit clk;
logic a, b;
...
dut dut (.*);
tb tb (.*);
endmodule
In the 11th clock cycle, observed deferred assertion a1 will first execute in the Active region, and it will fail
since at this point a and c are both 1. This pending assertion report will mature in the Observed region, and
the failure report will be scheduled in the Reactive region. However, in the Reactive region of the same time
step, the testbench will set a to 0, triggering another execution of the implied always_comb block
containing assertion a1 (see 16.4.3).This time a1 will pass. So both a pass and a fail message will be
displayed for a1 during this time step.
For final deferred assertion a2, the behavior will be different. As with a1, a pending assertion report will be
generated when the assertion fails in the Active region. However, when the value of a changes in the
Reactive region and the assertion's implicit always_comb is resumed, this creates a flush point, so this
pending report will be flushed. a2 will be executed again with the new value, and the new result will be put
on the deferred assertion report queue. In the Postponed region, this will mature, and the final passing result
of this assertion will be the only one reported.
#### 16.4.3 Deferred assertions outside procedural code

A deferred assertion statement may also appear outside procedural code, in which case it is referred to as a
static deferred assertion. In such cases, it is treated as if it were contained in an always_comb procedure.
For example:
module m (input a, b);
a1: assert #0 (a == b);
endmodule
This is equivalent to the following:
module m (input a, b);
always_comb begin
a1: assert #0 (a == b);
end
endmodule
Static deferred assertions in checkers are described in 17.3.

#### 16.4.4 Disabling deferred assertions

The disable statement shall interact with deferred assertions as follows:
—
A specific deferred assertion may be disabled. Any pending assertion reports for that assertion are
cancelled.
—
When a disable is applied to the outermost scope of a procedure that has an active deferred
assertion queue, in addition to normal disable activities (see 9.6.2), the deferred assertion report
queue is flushed and all pending assertion reports on the queue are cleared.
Disabling a task or a non-outermost scope of a procedure does not cause flushing of any pending reports.
The following example illustrates how user code can explicitly flush a pending assertion report. In this case,
failures of a1 are only reported in time steps where bad_val_ok does not settle at a value of 1.
always @(bad_val or bad_val_ok) begin : b1
a1: assert #0 (bad_val) else $fatal(1, "Sorry");
if (bad_val_ok) begin
disable a1;
end
end
The following example illustrates how user code can explicitly flush all pending assertion reports on the
deferred assertion queue of process b2:
always @(a or b or c) begin : b2
if (c == 8'hff) begin
a2: assert #0 (a && b);
end else begin
a3: assert #0 (a || b);
end
end
always @(clear_b2) begin : b3
disable b2;
end
#### 16.4.5 Deferred assertions and multiple processes

As described in the previous subclauses, deferred assertions are inherently associated with the process in
which they are executed. This means that a deferred assertion within a function may be executed several
times due to the function being called by several different processes, and each of these different process
executions is independent. The following example illustrates this situation:
module fsm(...);
function bit f (int a, int b)
...
a1: assert #0 (a == b);
...
endfunction
...
always_comb begin : b1
some_stuff = f(x,y) ? ...
...
end
always_comb begin : b2
other_stuff = f(z,w) ? ...

...
end
endmodule
In this case, there are two different processes that may call assertion a1: b1 and b2. Suppose simulation
executes the following scenario in the first passage through the Active region of each time step:
—
In time step 1, b1 executes with x!=y, and b2 executes with z!=w.
—
In time step 2, b1 executes with x!=y, then again with x==y.
—
In time step 3, b1 executes with x!=y, then b2 executes with z==w.
In the first time step, since a1 fails independently for processes b1 and b2, its failure is reported twice.
In the second time step, the failure of a1 in process b1 is flushed when the process is re-triggered, and since
the final execution passes, no failure is reported.
In the third time step, the failure in process b1 does not see a flush point, so that failure is reported. In
process b2, the assertion passes, so no failure is reported from that process.
### 16.5 Concurrent assertions overview

Concurrent assertions describe behavior that spans over time. Unlike immediate assertions, the evaluation
model is based on a clock so that a concurrent assertion is evaluated only at the occurrence of a clock tick.
The term clock tick refers to a time step when a clocking event of a sequence, property, sampled value
function, or assertion statement occurs. Due to the need to verify proper behavior of the system and conform
as closely as possible to cycle-based semantics, the clocking event should be glitch-free and only transition
once during any time step. If the clocking event transitions more than once during a time step, the resulting
behavior is undefined.
Concurrent assertions use the sampled values of their expressions except for disable conditions (see 16.12)
and clocking events. Expression sampling is explained in 16.5.1. Concurrent assertions are evaluated in the
Observed region.
#### 16.5.1 Sampling

Concurrent assertions and several other constructs (such as variables referenced in an always_ff procedure
in a checker, see 17.5) have special rules for sampling values of their expressions. The value of an
expression sampled in one of these constructs is called a sampled value. In most cases the sampled value of
an expression is its value in the Preponed region. This rule has, however, several important exceptions. The
rest of this subclause provides the formal definition of sampling.
The default sampled value of an expression is defined as follows:
—
The default sampled value of a static variable is the value assigned in its declaration, or, in the
absence of such an assignment, it is the default (or uninitialized) value of the corresponding type
(see 6.8, Table 6-7).
—
The default sampled value of any other variable or net is the default value of the corresponding type
(see 6.8, Table 6-7). For example, the default sampled value of variable y of type logic is 1'bx.
—
The default sampled value of the triggered event method (see 15.5.3) and the sequence methods
triggered and matched is false (1'b0) .
—
The default sampled value of an expression is defined recursively by evaluating the expression using
the default sampled values of its component subexpressions and variables.

A default sampled value is used in the definition of a sampled value of an expression as explained below,
and in the definition of sampled value functions when there is a need to reference a sampled value of an
expression before time zero (see 16.9.3).
The definition of a sampled value of an expression is based on the definition of a sampled value of a
variable. The general rule for variable sampling is as follows:
—
The sampled value of a variable in a time slot corresponding to time greater than 0 is the value of
this variable in the Preponed region of this time slot.
—
The sampled value of a variable in a time slot corresponding to time 0 is its default sampled value.
This rule has the following exceptions:
—
Sampled values of automatic variables (see 16.14.6), local variables (see 16.10), and active free
checker variables (see 17.7.2) are their current values. However,
•
When a past or a future value of an active free checker variable is referenced by a sampled value
function (see 16.9.3 and 16.9.4), this value is sampled in the Postponed region of the
corresponding past or future clock tick;
•
When a past or a future value of an automatic variable is referenced by a sampled value function,
the current value of the automatic variable is taken instead.
—
If a variable is an input variable of a clocking block, the variable shall be sampled by the clocking
block with #1step sampling. Any other type of sampling for the clocking block variable shall result
in an error. The sampled value of a such variable is the sampled value produced by the clocking
block. This is explained in Clause 14.
The sampled value of an expression is defined as follows:
—
The sampled value of an expression consisting of a single variable is the sampled value of this
variable.
—
The sampled value of a const cast expression (see 6.24.1 and 16.14.6) is defined as the current
value of its argument. For example, if a is a variable, then the sampled value of const'(a) is the
current value of a. When a past or a future value of a const cast expression is referenced by a
sampled value function, the current value of this expression is taken instead.
—
The sampled value of the triggered event method and the sequence methods triggered and
matched (see 16.13.6) is defined as the current value returned by the event property or sequence
method. When a past or a future value of an event property or sequence method is referenced by a
sampled value function (see 16.9.3 and 16.9.4), this value is sampled in the Postponed region of the
corresponding past or future clock tick.
—
The sampled value of any other expression is defined recursively using the values of its arguments.
For example, the sampled value of an expression e1 & e2, where e1 and e2 are expressions, is the
bitwise AND of the sampled values of e1 and e2. In particular, if an expression contains a function
call, to evaluate the sampled value of this expression, the function is called on the sampled values of
its arguments at the time of the expression evaluation. For example, if a is a static module variable,
s is a sequence, and f is a function, the sampled value of f(a, s.triggered) is the result of the
application of f to the sampled values of a and s.triggered, i.e., to the value of a taken from the
Preponed region and to the current value of s.triggered.
#### 16.5.2 Assertion clock

The timing model employed in a concurrent assertion specification is based on clock ticks and uses a
generalized notion of clock cycles. The definition of a clock is explicitly specified by the user and can vary
from one expression to another.

In an assertion, the sampled value is the only valid value of a variable during a clock tick. Figure 16-1 shows
the values of a variable as the clock progresses. The value of signal req is low at clock ticks 1 and 2. At
clock tick 3, the value is sampled as high and remains high until clock tick 6. The sampled value of variable
req at clock tick 6 is low and remains low up to and including clock tick 9. Notice that the simulation value
transitions to high at clock tick 9. However, the sampled value at clock tick 9 is low.
Figure 16-1—Sampling a variable in a simulation time step
An expression used in an assertion is always tied to a clock definition, except for the use of constant or
automatic values from procedural code (see 16.14.6). The sampled values are used to evaluate value change
expressions or Boolean subexpressions that are required to determine a match of a sequence.
For concurrent assertions, the following statements apply:
—
It is important that the defined clock behavior be glitch free. Otherwise, wrong values can be
sampled.
—
If a variable that appears in the expression for clock also appears in an expression with an assertion,
the values of the two usages of the variable can be different. The current value of the variable is used
in the clock expression, while the sampled value of the variable is used within the assertion.
The clock expression that controls evaluation of a sequence can be more complex than just a single signal
name. Expressions such as clk iff gating_signal can be used to represent a gated clock. Other more
complex expressions are possible. However, in order to verify proper behavior of the system and conform as
closely as possible to truly cycle-based semantics, the user should ensure that the clock expression is glitch-
free and only transitions once at any simulation time. (See 9.4.2.3 for the reasons that the expression clk
iff gating_signal avoids the potential glitch in the expression clk && gating_signal.)
A reference to $global_clock (see 14.14) is understood to be a reference to a clocking_event defined in a
global clocking declaration. A global clock behaves just as any other clocking event. In formal
verification, however, $global_clock has additional significance, as it is considered to be the primary
system clock (see F.3.1 ). Thus, in the following example:
global clocking @clk; endclocking
...
assert property(@$global_clock a);
the assertion states that a is true at each tick of the global clock. This assertion is logically equivalent to:
assert property(@clk a);
An example of a concurrent assertion is as follows:
base_rule1: assert property (cont_prop(rst,in1,in2)) $display("%m, passing");
else $display("%m, failed" );
The keyword property distinguishes a concurrent assertion from an immediate assertion. The syntax of
concurrent assertions is discussed in 16.14.

A sequence (see 16.7) may also be used in the clocking event for an assertion, just as in an event control, as
described in 9.4.2.4. It is important to recognize, though, that a normal (non-sequence-based) clock event
can be seen as an exception to the usual sampling behavior of concurrent assumptions: if a clock signal
transitions in the Active region, concurrent assertion statements are triggered during the Observed region of
that same time step. This exception may not apply to sequence-based event controls, if they depend on
sampled values used in a sequence. The following example illustrates this issue:
C1: cover property (@(posedge clk) mycond);
sequence seq1;
@(posedge clk) 1;
endsequence
C2: cover property (@seq1 mycond);
// fastclk is a clock driven at 2x the frequency of clk
sequence seq2;
@(posedge fastclk) !clk ##1 clk;
endsequence
C3: cover property (@seq2 mycond);
In the above example, assume that clk transitions from 0 to 1 during the Active region of a time step. Cover
properties C1 and C2 behave identically: each checks that the sampled value of mycond is 1 during time
steps where clk transitions to 1. However, the check on C3 will be delayed until a later time step, the
following posedge of fastclk: on the cycle where clk transitions to 1, that new value is not the controlling
sampled value of clk until the following time step.
### 16.6 Boolean expressions

The outcome of the evaluation of an expression is Boolean and is interpreted the same way as an expression
is interpreted in the condition of a procedural if statement. In other words, if the expression evaluates to x,
z, or 0, then it is interpreted as being false. Otherwise, it is true.
Expressions that appear in concurrent assertions shall satisfy the following requirements:
—
An expression shall result in a type that is cast compatible with an integral type. Subexpressions
need not meet this requirement as long as the overall expression is cast compatible with an integral
type.
—
Elements of dynamic arrays, queues, and associative arrays that are sampled for assertion expression
evaluation may get removed from the array or the array may get resized before the assertion
expression is evaluated. These specific array elements sampled for assertion expression evaluation
shall continue to exist within the scope of the assertion until the assertion expression evaluation
completes.
—
Expressions that appear in procedural concurrent assertions may reference automatic variables as
described in 16.14.6.1. Otherwise, expressions in concurrent assertions shall not reference automatic
variables.
—
Expressions shall not reference non-static class properties or methods.
—
Expressions shall not reference variables of the chandle data type.
—
Sequence match items with a local variable as the variable_lvalue may use the C assignment,
increment, and decrement operators. Otherwise, evaluation of an expression shall not have any side
effects (e.g., the increment and decrement operators are not allowed).
—
Functions that appear in expressions shall not contain output, inout, or ref arguments (const
ref is allowed).

Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
—
Functions shall be automatic (or preserve no state information) and have no side effects.
Care should be taken when accessing large data structures, especially large dynamic data structures, in
concurrent assertions. Some types of access may require creating a copy of the entire data structure, which
could incur a significant performance penalty. The following example illustrates how the need to copy an
entire data structure may arise. In p1 only a single byte of q will be sampled by the assertion, and the
location of that byte is constant. However, in p2 there will be multiple active threads with potentially
different values of l_b. This increases the difficulty of determining which bytes of q to sample and likely
results in sampling all of q.
bit a;
integer b;
byte q[$];
property p1;
$rose(a) |-> q[0];
endproperty
property p2;
integer l_b;
($rose(a), l_b = b) |-> ##[3:10] q[l_b];
endproperty
There are two places where Boolean expressions occur in concurrent assertions. They are as follows:
—
In a sequence or property expression
—
In the disable condition inferred for an assertion, specified either in a top-level disable iff clause
(see 16.12) or in a default disable iff declaration (see 16.15)
The Boolean expressions used in defining a sequence or property expression shall be evaluated over the
sampled values of all variables. The preceding rule shall not, however, apply to expressions in a clocking
event (see 16.5).
The expressions in a disable condition are evaluated using the current values of variables (not sampled) and
may contain the sequence Boolean method triggered. They shall not contain any reference to local
variables or to the sequence method matched.
Assertions that perform checks based on time values should capture these values in the same context. It is
not recommended to capture time outside of the assertion. Time should be captured within the assertion
using local variables. The following example illustrates how a problem may arise when capturing time in
different contexts. In property p1, a time value, t, is captured in a procedural context based on the current
value of count. Within the assertion, a comparison is made between the time value t and the time value
returned by $realtime in the assertion context based on the sampled value of count. In both contexts,
$realtime returns the current time value. As a result, the comparison between values of time captured in
the different contexts yields an inconsistent result. The inconsistency results in the computation for p1
checking the amount of time that elapses between 8 periods of clk instead of the intended 7. In property p2,
both time values are captured within the assertion context. This strategy yields a consistent result.
bit [2:0] count;
realtime t;
initial count = 0;
always @(posedge clk) begin
if (count == 0) t = $realtime; //capture t in a procedural context
count++;

Syntax 16-3—Sequence syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
Properties are often constructed out of sequential behaviors. The sequence feature provides the capability
to build and manipulate sequential behaviors. The simplest sequential behaviors are linear. A linear
sequence is a finite list of SystemVerilog Boolean expressions in a linear order of increasing time. The linear
sequence is said to match along a finite interval of consecutive clock ticks provided the first Boolean
expression evaluates to true at the first clock tick, the second Boolean expression evaluates to true at the
second clock tick, and so forth, up to and including the last Boolean expression evaluating to true at the last
clock tick. A single Boolean expression is an example of a simple linear sequence, and it matches at a single
clock tick provided the Boolean expression evaluates to true at that clock tick.
More complex sequential behaviors are described by SystemVerilog sequences. A sequence is a regular
expression over the SystemVerilog Boolean expressions that concisely specifies a set of zero, finitely many,
or infinitely many linear sequences. If at least one of the linear sequences from this set matches along a finite
interval of consecutive clock ticks, then the sequence is said to match along that interval.
A property may involve checking of one or more sequential behaviors beginning at various times. An
attempted evaluation of a sequence is a search for a match of the sequence beginning at a particular clock
tick. To determine whether such a match exists, appropriate Boolean expressions are evaluated beginning at
the particular clock tick and continuing at each successive clock tick until either a match is found or it is
deduced that no match can exist.
A sequence may admit an empty match, a match that occurs over an interval of length 0. (See a formal
definition at 16.12.22, and see 16.9.2.1 for more discussion of empty matches). An end point of a sequence
is the time step of any nonempty match of the sequence. An end point is reached whenever the ending clock
tick of a match of the sequence is reached, regardless of the starting clock tick of the match. A match point
includes both empty and nonempty matches, and is reached either at an end point or, in the case of an empty
match, at the length-0 time interval at the beginning of the time step when sequence evaluation begins. A
sequence that admits only empty matches is referred to as an empty sequence.
Sequences can be composed by concatenation, analogous to a concatenation of lists. The concatenation
specifies a delay, using ##, from the end of the first sequence until the beginning of the second sequence.
The syntax for sequence concatenation is shown in Syntax 16-4.

Syntax 16-4—Sequence concatenation syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
In this syntax, the following statements apply:
—
constant_primary is a constant_expression, which is computed at compile time and shall result in an
integer
value.
Furthermore,
constant_expression
and
the
bounds
in
cycle_delay_const_range_expression can only be 0 or greater.
—
The $ token is used to indicate a finite, but unbounded, maximum.
—
##[*] is used as an equivalent representation of ##[0:$].
—
##[+] is used as an equivalent representation of ##[1:$].
—
When a range is specified with two expressions, the second expression shall be greater than or equal
to the first expression.
—
In a cycle_delay_range, it shall be illegal for a constant_primary to contain a
constant_mintypmax_expression that is not also a constant_expression.
The context in which a sequence occurs determines when the sequence is evaluated. The first expression in a
sequence is checked at the first occurrence of the clock tick at or after the expression that triggered
evaluation of the sequence. Each successive element (if any) in the sequence is checked at the next
subsequent occurrence of the clock.
A ## followed by a number or range specifies the delay from the current clock tick to the beginning of the
sequence that follows. The delay ##1 indicates that the beginning of the sequence that follows is one clock
tick later than the current clock tick. The delay ##0 indicates that the beginning of the sequence that follows
is at the same clock tick as the current clock tick.
When used as a concatenation between two sequences, the delay is from the end of the first sequence to the
beginning of the second sequence. The delay ##1 indicates that the beginning of the second sequence is one
clock tick later than the end of the first sequence. The delay ##0 indicates that the beginning of the second
sequence is at the same clock tick as the end of the first sequence.
In the examples in this clause, `true is a Boolean expression that always evaluates to 1'b1 and is used for
visual clarity. It is defined as follows:
`define true 1'b1
##0 a
// means a
##1 a
// means `true ##1 a
##2 a
// means `true ##1 `true ##1 a
##[0:3]a
// means (a) or (`true ##1 a) or (`true ##1 `true ##1 a) or
// (`true ##1 `true ##1 `true ##1 a)

req ##1 gnt ##1 !req
specifies that req be true on the current clock tick, gnt shall be true on the first subsequent tick, and req
shall be false on the next clock tick after that. The ##1 operator specifies one clock tick separation. A delay
of more than one clock tick can be specified, as in the following:
req ##2 gnt
This specifies that req shall be true on the current clock tick, and gnt shall be true on the second subsequent
clock tick, as shown in Figure 16-2.
Figure 16-2—Concatenation of sequences
The following specifies that signal b shall be true on the Nth clock tick after signal a:
a ##N b
// check b on the Nth sample
To specify a concatenation of overlapped sequences, where the end point of one sequence coincides with the
start of the next sequence, a value of 0 is used, as follows:
a ##1 b ##1 c // first sequence seq1
d ##1 e ##1 f // second sequence seq2
(a ##1 b ##1 c) ##0 (d ##1 e ##1 f) // overlapped concatenation
In the preceding example, c is required to be true at the end point of sequence seq1, and d is required to be
true at the start of sequence seq2. When concatenated with 0 clock tick delay, c and d are required to be
true at the same time, resulting in a concatenated sequence equivalent to the following:
a ##1 b ##1 c&&d ##1 e ##1 f
It should be noted that no other form of overlapping between the sequences can be expressed using the
concatenation operation.
In cases where the delay can be any value in a range, a time window can be specified as follows:
req ##[4:32] gnt
In the preceding case, signal req is required to be true at the current clock tick, and signal gnt is required to
be true at some clock tick between the 4th and the 32nd clock tick after the current clock tick.
The time window can extend to a finite, but unbounded, range by using $ as in the following example:
req ##[4:$] gnt
A sequence can be unconditionally extended by concatenation with `true.
a ##1 b ##1 c ##3 `true

After satisfying signal c, the sequence length is extended by three clock ticks. Such adjustments in the
length of sequences can be required when complex sequences are constructed by combining simpler
sequences.

The default actual argument of an untyped formal argument may be of any type provided its substitution
results in a valid sequence as described in the rewriting algorithm (see F.4.1).
A formal argument may be referenced in the body of the declaration of the named sequence. A reference to
a formal argument may be written in place of various syntactic entities, such as the following:
—
identifier
—
expression
—
sequence_expr
—
event_expression
—
terminal $ in a cycle_delay_const_range_expression
A named sequence may be instantiated by referencing its name. The reference may be a hierarchical name
(see 23.6). A named sequence may be instantiated anywhere that a sequence_expr may be written, including
prior to its declaration. A named sequence may also be instantiated as part of a sequence_method_call (see
16.9.11, 16.13.5) or as an event_expression (see 9.4.2.4). It shall be an error if a cyclic dependency among
named sequences results from their instantiations. A cyclic dependency among named sequences results if,
and only if, there is a cycle in the directed graph whose nodes are the named sequences and whose edges are
defined by the following rule: there is a directed edge from one named sequence to a second named
sequence if, and only if, either the first named sequence instantiates the second named sequence within its
declaration, including an instance within the declaration of a default actual argument, or there is an instance
of the first named sequence that instantiates the second named sequence within an actual argument.
In an instance of a named sequence, actual arguments may be passed to formal arguments. The instance shall
provide an actual argument in the list of arguments for each formal argument that does not have a default
actual argument declared. The instance may provide an actual argument for a formal argument that has a
default actual argument, thereby overriding the default. Actual arguments in the list of arguments may be
bound to formal arguments by name or by position.
The terminal $ may be an actual argument in an instance of a named sequence, either declared as a default
actual argument or passed in the list of arguments of the instance. If $ is an actual argument, then the
corresponding formal argument shall be untyped and each of its references either shall be an upper bound in
a cycle_delay_const_range_expression or shall itself be an actual argument in an instance of a named
sequence.
If an instance of a named sequence is within the scope of a local variable (see 16.10), then an actual
argument in the list of arguments of the instance may reference the local variable.
Names other than formal arguments that appear in the declaration of a named sequence, including those that
appear in default actual arguments, shall be resolved according to the scoping rules from the scope of the

declaration of the named sequence. Names appearing in actual arguments in the list of arguments of the
instance shall be resolved according to the scoping rules from the scope of the instance of the named
sequence.
The sequential behavior and matching semantics of an instance of a named sequence are the same as those of
the flattened sequence that is obtained from the body of the declaration of the named sequence by the
rewriting algorithm defined in F.4.1. The rewriting algorithm substitutes actual arguments for references to
the corresponding formal arguments in the body of the declaration of the named sequence. The rewriting
algorithm does not itself account for name resolution and assumes that names have been resolved prior to the
substitution of actual arguments. If the flattened sequence is not legal, then the instance is not legal and there
shall be an error.
The substitution of an actual argument for a reference to the corresponding untyped formal argument in the
rewriting algorithm retains the actual as an expression term. An actual argument shall be enclosed in
parentheses and shall be cast to its self-determined type before being substituted for a reference to the
corresponding formal argument unless one of the following conditions holds:
—
The actual argument is $.
—
The actual argument is a variable_lvalue.
If the result of the rewriting algorithm is an invalid sequence, an error shall occur.
For example, a reference to an untyped formal argument may appear in the specification of a
cycle_delay_range, a boolean_abbrev, or a sequence_abbrev (see 16.9.2) only if the actual argument is an
elaboration-time constant. The following example illustrates such usage of formal arguments:
sequence delay_example(x, y, min, max, delay1);
x ##delay1 y[*min:max];
endsequence
// Legal
a1: assert property (@(posedge clk) delay_example(x, y, 3, $, 2));
int z, d;
// Illegal: z and d are not elaboration-time constants
a2_illegal: assert property (@(posedge clk) delay_example(x, y, z, $, d));
In the following example, named sequences s1 and s2 are evaluated on successive posedge events of clk.
The named sequence s3 is evaluated on successive negedge events of clk. The named sequence s4 is
evaluated on successive alternating posedge and negedge events of clk.
sequence s1;
@(posedge clk) a ##1 b ##1 c;
endsequence
sequence s2;
@(posedge clk) d ##1 e ##1 f;
endsequence
sequence s3;
@(negedge clk) g ##1 h ##1 i;
endsequence
sequence s4;
@(edge clk) j ##1 k ##1 l;
endsequence
Another example of named sequence declaration, which includes arguments, follows:

sequence s20_1(data,en);
(!frame && (data==data_bus)) ##1 (c_be[0:3] == en);
endsequence
Named sequence s20_1 does not specify a clock. In this case, a clock would be inherited from some
external source, such as a property or an assert statement. An example of instantiating a named
sequence is shown as follows:
sequence s;
a ##1 b ##1 c;
endsequence
sequence rule;
@(posedge sysclk)
trans ##1 start_trans ##1 s ##1 end_trans;
endsequence
Named sequence rule in the preceding example is equivalent to the following:
sequence rule;
@(posedge sysclk)
trans ##1 start_trans ##1 (a ##1 b ##1 c) ##1 end_trans ;
endsequence
The following example illustrates an illegal cyclic dependency among the named sequences s1 and s2:
sequence s1;
@(posedge sysclk) (x ##1 s2);
endsequence
sequence s2;
@(posedge sysclk) (y ##1 s1);
endsequence
#### 16.8.1 Typed formal arguments in sequence declarations

The data type specified for a formal argument of a sequence may be the keyword untyped. A formal
argument shall be untyped (see 16.8) if its data type is untyped. The semantics of binding an actual
argument expression to a formal with a data type of untyped shall be the same as the semantics for an
untyped formal. The keyword untyped shall be used if an untyped formal argument follows a data type in
the formal argument list.
If a formal argument of a named sequence is typed, then the type shall be sequence or one of the types
allowed in 16.6. The following rules apply to typed formal arguments and their corresponding actual
arguments, including default actual arguments declared in a named sequence:
a)
If the formal argument is of type sequence, then the actual argument shall be a sequence_expr. A
reference to the formal argument of type sequence shall either be in a place where a sequence_expr
is legal, or as an operand of sequence methods triggered and matched.
b)
If the formal argument is of type event, then the actual argument shall be an event_expression and
each reference to the formal argument shall be in a place where an event_expression may be written.
c)
Otherwise, the self-determined result type of the actual argument shall be cast compatible (see
6.22.4) with the type of the formal argument. If the actual argument is a variable_lvalue, references
to the formal shall be considered as having the formal’s type with any assignment to the formal
being treated as though there was a subsequent assignment from the formal to the actual argument. If
the actual argument is not a variable_lvalue, the actual argument shall be cast to the type of the
formal argument before being substituted for a reference to the formal argument in the rewriting
algorithm (see F.4.1).

For example, a Boolean expression may be passed as an actual argument to a formal argument of type
sequence because a Boolean expression is a sequence_expr. A formal argument of type sequence may
not be referenced as the expression_or_dist operand of a goto_repetition (see 16.9.2), regardless of the
corresponding actual argument, because a sequence_expr may not be written in that position.
A reference to a typed formal argument within a sequence_match_item (see 16.10) shall not stand as the
variable_lvalue in either an operator_assignment or an inc_or_dec_expression unless the formal argument
is a local variable argument (see 16.8.2, 16.12.19).
Two examples of declaring formal arguments follow. All of the formal arguments of s1 are untyped. The
formal arguments w and y of s2 are untyped, while the formal argument x has type bit.
sequence s1(w, x, y);
w ##1 x ##[2:10] y;
endsequence
sequence s2(w, y, bit x);
w ##1 x ##[2:10] y;
endsequence
The following instances of s1 and s2 are equivalent:
s1(.w(a), .x(bit'(b)), .y(c))
s2(.w(a), .x(b), .y(c))
In the instance of s2 above, if b happens to be 8 bits wide then it will be cast to bit by truncation since it is
being passed to a formal argument of type bit. Similarly, if an expression of type bit is passed as actual
argument to a formal argument of type byte, then the expression is extended to a byte.
If a reference to a typed formal argument appears in the specification of a cycle_delay_range, a
boolean_abbrev, or a sequence_abbrev (see 16.9.2), then the type of the formal argument shall be
shortint, int, or longint. The following example illustrates such usage of formal arguments:
sequence delay_arg_example (max, shortint delay1, delay2, min);
x ##delay1 y[*min:max] ##delay2 z;
endsequence
parameter my_delay=2;
cover property (delay_arg_example($, my_delay, my_delay-1, 3));
The cover property in the preceding example is equivalent to the following:
cover property (x ##2 y[*3:$] ##1 z);
The following shows an example of a formal argument with event type:
sequence event_arg_example (event ev);
@(ev) x ##1 y;
endsequence
cover property (event_arg_example(posedge clk));
The cover property in the preceding example is equivalent to the following:
cover property (@(posedge clk) x ##1 y));

If the intent is to pass as actual argument an expression that will be combined with an edge_identifier to
create an event_expression, then the formal argument shall not be typed with type event. The following
example illustrates such usage:
sequence event_arg_example2 (reg sig);
@(posedge sig) x ##1 y;
endsequence
cover property (event_arg_example2(clk));
The cover property in the preceding example is equivalent to the following:
cover property (@(posedge clk) x ##1 y));
Another example, in which a local variable is used to sample a formal argument, shows how to get the effect
of “pass by value.” Pass by value is not currently supported as a mode of argument passing.
sequence s(bit a, bit b);
bit loc_a;
(1'b1, loc_a = a) ##0
(t == loc_a) [*0:$] ##1 b;
endsequence
#### 16.8.2 Local variable formal arguments in sequence declarations

This subclause describes mechanisms for declaring local variable formal arguments and rules specific to
their use. Local variable formal arguments are special cases of local variables (see 16.10).
A formal argument of a named sequence may be designated as a local variable argument by specifying the
keyword local in the port item, followed optionally by one of the directions input, inout, or output. If
no direction is specified explicitly, then the direction input shall be inferred. If the keyword local is
specified in a port item, then the type of that argument shall be specified explicitly in that port item and shall
not be inferred from a previous argument. The type of a local variable argument shall be one of the types
allowed in 16.6. If one of the directions input, inout, or output is specified in a port item, then the
keyword local shall be specified in that port item.
The designation of a formal argument as a local variable argument of a given direction and type shall apply
to subsequent identifiers in the port list as long as none of the subsequent port items specifies the keyword
local or an explicit type. In other words, if a port item consists only of an identifier and if the nearest
preceding argument with an explicitly specified type also specifies the keyword local, then the port item is
a local variable argument with the same direction and type as that preceding argument.
If a local variable formal argument has direction input, then a default actual argument may be specified for
that argument in the optional declaration assignment in the port item, subject to the rules for default actual
arguments described in 16.8. It shall be illegal to specify a default actual argument for a local variable
argument of direction inout or output.
An example showing a legal declaration of a named sequence using local variable formal arguments is as
follows:
logic b_d, d_d;
sequence legal_loc_var_formal (
local inout logic a,
local logic b = b_d, // input inferred, default actual argument b_d
c,
// local input logic inferred, no default

// actual argument
d = d_d, // local input logic inferred, default actual
// argument d_d
logic e, f
// e and f are not local variable formal arguments
);
logic g = c, h = g || d;
...
endsequence
An example showing an illegal declaration of a named sequence using local variable formal arguments is as
follows:
sequence illegal_loc_var_formal (
output logic
a,
// illegal: local requires a direction
//          be specified
local inout logic b,
c = 1'b0,// default actual argument illegal for inout
local
d = expr,// illegal: explicit type required
local event
e,
// illegal: event is a type disallowed in
// 16.6
local logic
f = g
// g shall not refer to the local variable
// below and shall be resolved upward from
// this declaration
);
logic g = b;
...
endsequence
In general, a local variable formal argument behaves in the same way as a local variable declared in an
assertion_variable_declaration. The rules in 16.10 for assigning to and referencing local variables,
including the rules of local variable flow, apply to local variable formal arguments with the following
provisions:
—
Without further specification, the term local variable shall mean either a local variable formal
argument or a local variable declared in an assertion_variable_declaration.
—
At the beginning of each evaluation attempt of an instance of a named sequence, a new copy of each
of its local variable formal arguments shall be created.
—
A local variable formal argument with direction input or inout shall be treated like a local
variable declared in an assertion_variable_declaration with a declaration assignment. The initial
value for the local variable formal argument is provided by the associated actual argument for the
instance. The self-determined result type of the actual argument shall be cast compatible (see 6.22.4)
with the type of the local variable formal argument. The value of the actual argument shall be cast to
the type of the local variable formal argument before being assigned as initial value to the local
variable formal argument. This assignment is referred to as the initialization assignment of the local
variable formal argument. Initialization of all input and inout local variable formal arguments shall
be
performed
before
initialization
of
any
local
variable
declared
in
an
assertion_variable_declaration. The expression of a declaration assignment to a local variable
declared in an assertion_variable_declaration may refer to a local variable formal argument of
direction input or inout.
—
If a local variable formal argument of direction input or inout is bound to an actual argument in
the argument list of an instance and if the actual argument references a local variable, then it shall be
an error if that local variable is unassigned at the point of the reference in the context of the instance.
—
A local variable formal argument of direction output shall be unassigned at the beginning of the
evaluation attempt of the instance.

—
The entire actual argument expression bound to an inout or output local variable formal argument
shall itself be a reference to a local variable whose scope includes the instance and with whose type
the type of the local variable formal argument is cast compatible. It shall be an error if references to
the same local variable are bound as actual arguments to two or more local variable formal
arguments of direction inout or output. It shall be an error if there exists a match of the named
sequence for which an inout or output local variable formal argument is unassigned at the
completion of the match. At the completion of a match of the instance of the named sequence, the
value of the inout or output local variable formal argument shall be cast to the type of and assigned
to the local variable whose reference is the associated actual argument. If multiple threads of
evaluation of the instance of the named sequence match, then multiple threads of evaluation shall
continue in the instantiation context, each with its own copy of the actual argument local variable.
For each matching thread of the instance of the named sequence, at the completion of the match of
that thread the value of the local variable formal argument in that thread shall be cast to the type of
and assigned to the associated copy of the actual argument local variable.
—
It shall be an error for an instance of a named sequence with an inout or output local variable
formal argument to admit an empty match (see 16.12.22).
—
It shall be an error to apply any of the sequence methods triggered (see 16.9.11, 16.13.6) or
matched (see 16.13.5) to an instance of a named sequence with an input or inout local variable
formal argument.
The following example illustrates legal usage of a local variable formal argument:
sequence sub_seq2(local inout int lv);
(a ##1 !a, lv += data_in)
##1 !b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == lv);
endsequence
sequence seq2;
int v1;
(c, v1 = data)
##1 sub_seq2(v1)
// lv is initialized by assigning it the value of v1;
// when the instance sub_seq2(v1) matches, v1 is
// assigned the value of lv
##1 (do1 == v1);
endsequence
The matching behavior of seq2 is equivalent to that of seq2_inlined as follows:
sequence seq2_inlined;
int v1, lv;
(c, v1 = data) ##1
(
(1, lv = v1) ##0
(a ##1 !a, lv += data_in)
##1 (!b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == lv), v1 = lv)
)
##1 (do1 == v1);
endsequence
Untyped arguments provide an alternative mechanism for passing local variables to an instance of a
subsequence, including the capability to assign to the local variable in the subsequence and later reference
the value assigned in the instantiation context (see 16.10).

The number of iterations of a repetition can either be specified by exact count or be required to fall within a
finite range. If specified by exact count, then the number of iterations is defined by a non-negative integer
constant expression (see 11.2.1). If required to fall within a finite range, then the minimum number of
iterations is defined by a non-negative integer constant expression, and the maximum number of iterations
either is defined by a non-negative integer constant expression or is $, indicating a finite, but unbounded,
maximum.
If both the minimum and maximum numbers of iterations are defined by non-negative integer constant
expressions, then the minimum number shall be less than or equal to the maximum number.
See 16.9.2.1 for discussion of the special case where the number of iterations is 0.
The following three kinds of repetition are provided:
—
Consecutive repetition ( [*const_or_range_expression] ): Consecutive repetition specifies finitely
many iterative matches of the operand sequence, with a delay of one clock tick from the end of one
match to the beginning of the next. The overall repetition sequence matches at the end of the last
iterative match of the operand. [*] is an equivalent representation of [*0:$] and [+] is an
equivalent representation of [*1:$].
—
Goto repetition ( [->const_or_range_expression] ): Goto repetition specifies finitely many
iterative matches of the operand Boolean expression, with a delay of one or more clock ticks from
one match of the operand to the next successive match and no match of the operand strictly in
between. The overall repetition sequence matches at the last iterative match of the operand.
—
Nonconsecutive repetition ( [=const_or_range_expression] ): Nonconsecutive repetition specifies
finitely many iterative matches of the operand Boolean expression, with a delay of one or more
clock ticks from one match of the operand to the next successive match and no match of the operand
strictly in between. The overall repetition sequence matches at or after the last iterative match of the
operand, but before any later match of the operand.
The effect of consecutive repetition of a subsequence within a sequence can be achieved by explicitly
iterating the subsequence, as follows:
a ##1 b ##1 b ##1 b ##1 c
Using the consecutive repetition operator [*3], which indicates three iterations, this sequential behavior is
specified more succinctly:
a ##1 b [*3] ##1 c
A consecutive repetition specifies that the operand sequence shall match a specified number of times. The
consecutive repetition operator [*N] specifies that the operand sequence shall match N times in succession.
For example:
a [*3] // means a ##1 a ##1 a
The syntax allows the combination of a delay and repetition in the same sequence. The following are both
allowed:
a ##3 (b[*3])
// means a ##1 `true ##1 `true ##1 (b ##1 b ##1 b)
(a ##2 b)[*3]
// means (a ##2 b) ##1 (a ##2 b) ##1 (a ##2 b),
// which in turn means
// (a ##1 `true ##1 b) ##1 (a ##1 `true ##1 b) ##1 (a ##1 `true ##1 b)
A repetition with a range of minimum min and maximum max number of iterations can be expressed with
the consecutive repetition operator [* min:max].

For example:
(a ##2 b)[*1:5]
is equivalent to
(a ##2 b)
or (a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b)
or (a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b)
or (a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b)
or (a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b ##1 a ##2 b)
Similarly,
(a[*0:3] ##1 b ##1 c)
is equivalent to
(b ##1 c)
or (a ##1 b ##1 c)
or (a ##1 a ##1 b ##1 c)
or (a ##1 a ##1 a ##1 b ##1 c)
To specify a finite, but unbounded, number of iterations, the dollar sign ( $ ) is used. For example, the
repetition
a ##1 b [*1:$] ##1 c
matches over an interval of three or more consecutive clock ticks if a is true on the first clock tick, c is true
on the last clock tick, and b is true at every clock tick strictly in between the first and the last.
Specifying the number of iterations of a repetition by exact count is equivalent to specifying a range in
which the minimum number of repetitions is equal to the maximum number of repetitions. In other words,
seq[*n] is equivalent to seq[*n:n].
The goto repetition (nonconsecutive exact repetition) takes a Boolean expression rather than a sequence as
operand. It specifies the iterative matching of the Boolean expression at clock ticks that are not necessarily
consecutive and ends at the last iterative match. For example:
a ##1 b [->2:10] ##1 c
matches over an interval of consecutive clock ticks provided a is true on the first clock tick, c is true on the
last clock tick, b is true on the penultimate clock tick, and, including the penultimate, there are at least 2 and
at most 10 not necessarily consecutive clock ticks strictly in between the first and last on which b is true.
This sequence is equivalent to the following:
a ##1 ((!b[*0:$] ##1 b) [*2:10]) ##1 c
The nonconsecutive repetition is like the goto repetition except that a match does not have to end at the last
iterative match of the operand Boolean expression. The use of nonconsecutive repetition instead of goto
repetition allows the match to be extended by arbitrarily many clock ticks provided the Boolean expression
is false on all of the extra clock ticks. For example:
a ##1 b [=2:10] ##1 c

matches over an interval of consecutive clock ticks provided a is true on the first clock tick, c is true on the
last clock tick, and there are at least 2 and at most 10 not necessarily consecutive clock ticks strictly in
between the first and last on which b is true. This sequence is equivalent to the following:
a ##1 ((!b [*0:$] ##1 b) [*2:10]) ##1 !b[*0:$] ##1 c
The consecutive repetition operator can be applied to general sequence expressions, but the goto repetition
and nonconsecutive repetition operators can be applied only to Boolean expressions. In particular, goto
repetition and nonconsecutive repetition cannot be applied to a Boolean expression to which a sequence
match item (see 16.10, 16.11) has been attached. For example, the following is a legal sequence expression:
(b[->1], v = e)[*2]
but the following is illegal:
(b, v = e)[->2]
##### 16.9.2.1 Repetition, concatenation, and empty matches

Using 0 as a sequence repetition number, an empty sequence (see 16.7) results, as in this example:
a [*0]
Because empty matches occur over an interval of zero clock ticks and are thus of length 0, they follow the
set of concatenation rules specified below. In the following rules, an empty sequence is denoted as empty,
and another sequence (which may be empty or nonempty) is denoted as seq.
—
(empty ##0 seq) does not result in a match.
—
(seq ##0 empty) does not result in a match.
—
(empty ##n seq), where n is greater than 0, is equivalent to (##(n-1) seq).
—
(seq ##n empty), where n is greater than 0, is equivalent to (seq ##(n-1) `true).
For example, compare the following two sequences:
a[*0] ##0 b
`true ##0 b
As defined by the preceding rules, the first sequence can never be matched: there is no point in time when
the end point of the length-0 sequence a[*0] and the length-1 sequence ##0 b are aligned. In contrast, the
second is a well-defined sequence representing the fusion of two sequences of length 1. It will match during
any time step when the sampled value of b is true.
To apply these rules to a sequence admitting both empty and nonempty matches, rewrite the sequence as the
OR of its empty and nonempty cases. Consider the multiple concatenation example:
b ##1 a[*0:1] ##2 c
This is equivalent to:
(b ##1 a[*0] ##2 c) or (b ##1 a[*1] ##2 c)
which can be rewritten as:
(b ##1 ##1 c) or (b ##1 a ##2 c)

or, more concisely:
(b ##2 c) or (b ##1 a ##2 c)
From this example, we can see that when matching the 0-tick interval specified by the empty case a[*0],
the total execution time of the sequence is one less than when using the 1-tick interval specified by a[*1].
#### 16.9.3 Sampled value functions

This subclause describes the system functions available for accessing sampled values of an expression.
These functions include the capability to access current sampled value, access sampled value in the past, or
detect changes in sampled value of an expression. Sampling of an expression is explained in 16.5.1. Local
variables (see 16.10) and the sequence method matched are not allowed in the argument expressions passed
to these functions. The following functions are provided:
$sampled ( expression )
$rose    ( expression [ , [ clocking_event ] ] )
$fell    ( expression [ , [ clocking_event ] ] )
$stable  ( expression [ , [ clocking_event ] ] )
$changed ( expression [ , [ clocking_event ] ] )
$past    ( expression1 [ , [ number_of_ticks ] [ , [ expression2 ] [ , [ clocking_event ] ] ] ] )
The use of these functions is not limited to assertion features; they may be used as expressions in procedural
code as well. The clocking event, although optional as an explicit argument to the functions $past, $rose,
$stable, $changed, and $fell, is required for their semantics. The clocking event is used to sample
the value of the argument expression.
The function $sampled does not use a clocking event.
For a sampled value function other than $sampled, the clocking event shall be explicitly specified as an
argument or inferred from the code where the function is called. The following rules are used to infer the
clocking event:
—
If called in an assertion, sequence, or property, the appropriate clocking event as determined by
clock flow rules (see 16.13.3) is used.
—
Otherwise, if called in a disable condition or a clock expression in an assertion, sequence, or
property, it shall be explicitly clocked.
—
Otherwise, if called in an action block of an assertion, the leading clock of the assertion is used.
—
Otherwise, if called in a procedure, the inferred clock, if any, from the procedural context (see
16.14.6) is used.
—
Otherwise, if called outside an assertion, default clocking (see 14.12) is used.
The function $sampled returns the sampled value of its argument (see 16.5.1). The use of $sampled in
concurrent assertions, although allowed, is redundant, as the result of the function is identical to the sampled
value of the expression itself used in the assertion. The use of $sampled in a disable iff clause is
meaningful since the disable condition by default is not sampled (see 16.12).
The function $sampled is useful to access the value of expressions used in concurrent assertions in their
action blocks. Consider the following example:
logic a, b, clk;
// ...
a1_bad: assert property (@clk a == b)

else $error("Different values: a = %b, b = %b", a, b);
a2_ok: assert property (@clk a == b)
else $error("Different values: a = %b, b = %b",
$sampled(a), $sampled(b));
If in some clock tick the sampled value of a is 0 and of b is 1, but their current values in the Reactive region
of this tick are 0, then assertion a1_bad will report Different values: a = 0, b = 0. This is because
action blocks are evaluated in the Reactive region (see 16.14.1). Assertion a2_ok reports the intended
message Different values: a = 0, b = 1 because the values of a and b in its action block are
evaluated in the same context as in the assertion.
The following functions are called value change functions and are provided to detect changes in sampled
values: $rose, $fell, $stable, and $changed.
A value change function detects a change (or, in the case of $stable, lack of change) in the sampled value
of an expression. The change (or lack of change) is determined by comparing the sampled value of the
expression with the sampled value of the expression from the most recent strictly prior time step in which
the clocking event occurred (see 16.5.1 for the definition of sampling in past clock ticks and the following
description of $past for how past values are evaluated). The result of a value change function is true or
false and a call to a value change function may be used as a Boolean expression. The results of value change
functions shall be determined as follows:
—
$rose returns true (1'b1) if the LSB of the expression changed to 1. Otherwise, it returns false
(1'b0).
—
$fell returns true (1'b1) if the LSB of the expression changed to 0. Otherwise, it returns false
(1'b0).
—
$stable returns true (1'b1) if the value of the expression did not change. Otherwise, it returns
false (1'b0).
—
$changed returns true (1'b1) if the value of the expression changed. Otherwise, it returns false
(1'b0).
When these functions are called at or before the simulation time step in which the first clocking event
occurs, the results are computed by comparing the sampled value of the expression with its default sampled
value (see 16.5.1).
Figure 16-3 illustrates two examples of value changes:
—
Value change expression e1 is defined as $rose(req).
—
Value change expression e2 is defined as $fell(ack).
The clock ticks used for sampling the variables are derived from the clock for the property, which is
different from the simulation time steps. Assume, for now, that this clock is defined elsewhere. At clock tick
3, e1 occurs because the value of req at clock tick 2 was low and the value at clock tick 3 is high. Similarly,
e2 occurs at clock tick 6 because the value of ack was sampled as high at clock tick 5 and sampled as low at
clock tick 6.

Figure 16-3—Value change expressions
The following example illustrates the use of $rose in SystemVerilog code outside assertions:
always @(posedge clk)
reg1 <= a & $rose(b);
In this example, the clocking event @(posedge clk) is applied to $rose. $rose is true whenever the
sampled value of b changed to 1 from its sampled value at the previous tick of the clocking event.
Past sampled values can be accessed with the $past function. The following three optional arguments are
provided:
—
expression2 is used as a gating expression for the clocking event.
—
number_of_ticks specifies the number of clock ticks in the past.
—
clocking_event specifies the clocking event for sampling expression1.
expression1 and expression2 may be any expression allowed in assertions. If expression2 is not specified,
then it defaults to 1'b1.
number_of_ticks shall be 1 or greater and shall be an elaboration-time constant expression. If
number_of_ticks is not specified, then it defaults to 1.
$past returns the sampled value of expression1 in a particular time step strictly prior to the one in which
$past is evaluated (see 16.5.1 for the definition of sampling in past clock ticks). If number_of_ticks equals
k and if ev is the event expression underlying clocking_event, then the particular time step is the kth strictly
prior time step in which the event ev iff expression2 occurred. If there do not exist k strictly prior time
steps in which the event ev iff expression2 occurred, then the value returned from the $past function is the
default sampled value of expression1 (see 16.5.1).
The clocking event for $past shall be explicitly specified through the clocking_event argument or inferred
from the code where $past is called. The rules for inferring the clocking event are described previously.
When intermediate optional arguments between two arguments are not needed, a comma shall be placed for
each omitted argument. For example:
$past(in1, , enable);

Here, a comma is specified to omit number_of_ticks. The default of 1 is used for the empty number_of_ticks
argument. There is no need to include a comma for the omitted clocking_event argument, as it does not fall
within the specified arguments.
$past can be used in any SystemVerilog expression. An example follows.
always @(posedge clk)
reg1 <= a & $past(b);
In this example, the inferred clocking event @(posedge clk) is applied to $past. $past is evaluated in
the current occurrence of (posedge clk) and returns the value of b sampled at the previous occurrence of
(posedge clk).
The function $past may refer to automatic variables, e.g., to procedural loop variables, as follows:
always @(posedge clk)
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i ++)
if (cond[i])
reg1[i] <= $past(b[i]);
According to the definition of the past sampled value (see 16.5.1), $past returns at each loop iteration the
past value of the i-th bit of b.
It shall be illegal to use automatic variables in clocking events and expression2 of $past.
When expression2 is specified, the sampling of expression1 is performed based on its clock gated with
expression2. For example:
always @(posedge clk)
if (enable) q <= d;
always @(posedge clk)
assert property (done |=> (out == $past(q, 2,enable)) );
In this example, the sampling of q for evaluating $past is based on the following clocking expression:
posedge clk iff enable
The clocking event argument of a sampled value function may be different from the clocking event of the
context in which it is called, as determined by the clock resolution (see 16.16).
Consider the following assertions:
bit clk, fclk, req, gnt, en;
...
a1: assert property
(@(posedge clk) en && $rose(req) |=> gnt);
a2: assert property
(@(posedge clk) en && $rose(req, @(posedge fclk)) |=> gnt);
Both assertions a1 and a2 read: “whenever en is high and req rises, at the next cycle gnt shall be asserted.”
In both assertions, the rise of req occurs if and only if the sampled value of req at the current posedge of
clk is 1'b1 and the sampled value of req at a particular prior point is distinct from 1'b1. The assertions
differ in the specification of the prior point. In a1 the prior point is the preceding posedge of clk, while in
a2 the prior point is the most recent prior posedge of fclk.

As another example,
always_ff @(posedge clk1)
reg1 <= $rose(b, @(posedge clk2));
Here, reg1 is updated in each time step in which posedge clk1 occurs, using the value returned from the
$rose sampled value function in that time step. $rose compares the sampled value of the LSB of b from
the current time step (one in which posedge clk1 occurs) with the sampled value of the LSB of b in the
strictly prior time step in which posedge clk2 occurs.
The following example is illegal if it is not within the scope of a default clocking because no clock can be
inferred:
always @(posedge clk) begin
...
@(negedge clk2);
x = $past(y, 5); // illegal if not within default clocking
end
This example is legal if it is within the scope of a default clocking.
#### 16.9.4 Global clocking past and future sampled value functions

This subclause describes the system functions available for accessing the nearest past and future values of an
expression as sampled by the global clock. They may be used only if global clocking is defined (see 14.14).
These functions include the capability to access the sampled value at the global clock tick that immediately
precedes or follows the time step at which the function is called. Sampled value is explained in 16.5.1. The
following functions are provided.
Global clocking past sampled value functions are as follows:
$past_gclk ( expression )
$rose_gclk ( expression )
$fell_gclk ( expression )
$stable_gclk ( expression )
$changed_gclk ( expression )
Global clocking future sampled value functions are as follows:
$future_gclk ( expression )
$rising_gclk ( expression )
$falling_gclk ( expression )
$steady_gclk ( expression )
$changing_gclk ( expression )
The behavior of the global clocking past sampled value functions can be defined using the sampled value
functions as follows (the symbol
 means here “is equivalent by definition”):
$past_gclk(v)
 $past(v,,,
@$global_clock)
$rose_gclk(v)
 $rose(v,
@$global_clock)
$fell_gclk(v)
 $fell(v,
@$global_clock)
$stable_gclk(v)
 $stable(v, @$global_clock)
$changed_gclk(v)
 $changed(v, @$global_clock)

IEEE Std 1800-2023
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
419
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
The global clocking future sampled value functions are similar except that they use the subsequent value of
the expression.
$future_gclk(v) is the sampled value of v at the next global clock tick (see 16.5.1 for the definition of
sampling in future clock ticks).
The other functions are defined as follows:
—
$rising_gclk(expression) returns true (1'b1) if the sampled value of the LSB of the
expression is changing to 1 at the next global clocking tick. Otherwise, it returns false (1'b0).
—
$falling_gclk(expression) returns true (1'b1) if the sampled value of the LSB of the
expression is changing to 0 at the next global clocking tick. Otherwise, it returns false (1'b0).
—
$steady_gclk(expression) returns true (1'b1) if the sampled value of the expression does not
change at the next global clock tick. Otherwise, it returns false (1'b0).
—
$changing_gclk(expression)
is
the
complement
of
$steady_gclk,
i.e.,
!$steady_gclk(expression).
The global clocking future sampled value functions may be invoked only in property_expr or in
sequence_expr; this implies that they shall not be used in assertion action blocks. The global clocking past
sampled value functions are a special case of the sampled value functions, and therefore the regular
restrictions imposed on the sampled value functions and their arguments apply (see 16.9.3). In particular, the
global clocking past sampled value functions are usable in general procedural code and action blocks.
Additional restrictions are imposed on the usage of the global clocking future sampled value functions: they
shall not be nested and they shall not be used in assertions containing sequence match items (see 16.10,
16.11).
The following example illustrates the illegal usage of the global clocking future sampled value functions:
// Illegal: global clocking future sampled value functions
// shall not be nested
a1: assert property (@clk $future_gclk(a || $rising_gclk(b));
sequence s;
bit v;
(a, v = a) ##1 (b == v)[->1];
endsequence : s
// Illegal: a global clocking future sampled value function shall not
// be used in an assertion containing sequence match items
a2: assert property (@clk s |=> $future_gclk(c));
Even though global clocking future sampled value functions depend on future values of their arguments, the
interval of simulation time steps for an evaluation attempt of an assertion containing global clocking future
sampled value functions is defined as though the future sampled values were known in advance. The end of
the evaluation attempt is defined to be the last tick of the assertion clock and is not delayed any additional
time steps up to the next global clocking tick.
The behavior of disable iff and other asynchronous assertion related controls such as $assertcontrol
(see 20.11) is with respect to the interval of the evaluation attempt previously defined. If, for example,
$assertcontrol with control_type 5 (Kill) is executed in a time step strictly after the last tick of the
assertion clock for the evaluation attempt, then it shall not affect that attempt, even if $assertcontrol is
executed no later than the next global clocking tick.
Execution of the action block of an assertion containing global clocking future sampled value functions shall
be delayed until the global clocking tick that follows the last tick of the assertion clock for the attempt. If the

evaluation attempt fails and $error is called by default (see 16.14.1), then $error shall be called at the
global clocking tick that follows the last tick of the assertion clock.
A tool specific message that reports the starting or ending time step of an evaluation attempt of an assertion
containing global clocking future sampled functions shall be consistent with the preceding definition of the
interval of simulation time steps for the evaluation attempt. The message may also report the time step in
which it is written, which may be that of the global clocking tick that follows the last tick of the assertion
clock.
Example 1:
Table 16-2 shows the values returned by the global clocking future sampled value functions for sig at
different time moments.
The following assertion states that the signal may change only on falling clock:
a1: assert property (@$global_clock $changing_gclk(sig)
|-> $falling_gclk(clk))
else $error("sig is not stable");
In Figure 16-4, the vertical arrows indicate the ticks of the global clock. The assertion a1 is violated at time
## 80 because $changing_gclk(sig) is true and $falling_gclk(clk) is false. Because the assertion

contains global clocking future sampled value functions, the severity system task $error("sig is not
stable") in the action block is executed at time 90. If, as part of the tool-specific message printed by
$error, a tool reports the ending or failing time of this evaluation attempt, the time reported is 80.
Figure 16-4—Future value change

Example 2:
The following assumption states that a signal sig shall remain stable between two falling edges of a clock
clk as sampled by global clocking. This differs from the property in Example 1 in the case where the first

following assertion:
a3: assert property (@$global_clock disable iff (rst) $changing_gclk(sig)

else $error("sig is not stable");
fails at time 80 (see Figure 16-4) since rst is inactive at time 80. The interval of the failing evaluation
attempt starts and ends at time 80. Although rst is active prior to the execution of the action block at time
90, the attempt is not disabled.
Example 4:
In some cases, the global clocking future value functions provide a more natural expression of a property
than the past value functions. For example, the following two assertions are equivalent:
// A ##1 is needed in a4 due to the corner case at cycle 0
a4: assert property (##1 $stable_gclk(sig));
// In a5, there is no issue at cycle 0
a5: assert property ($steady_gclk(sig));
#### 16.9.5 AND operation

The binary operator and is used when both operands are expected to match, but the end times of the operand
sequences can be different (see Syntax 16-7).
```ebnf
sequence_expr ::=
```

// from A.2.10
...
| sequence_expr and sequence_expr
Syntax 16-7—And operator syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The two operands of and are sequences. The requirement for the match of the and operation is that both the
operands shall match. The operand sequences start at the same time. When one of the operand sequences
matches, it waits for the other to match. The end time of the composite sequence is the end time of the
operand sequence that completes last.
When te1 and te2 are sequences, then the composite sequence
te1 and te2
matches if te1 and te2 match. The end time is the end time of either te1 or te2, whichever matches last.
The following example is a sequence with operator and, where the two operands are sequences:
(te1 ##2 te2) and (te3 ##2 te4 ##2 te5)

The operation as illustrated in Figure 16-5 shows the evaluation attempt at clock tick 8. Here, the two
operand sequences are (te1 ##2 te2) and (te3 ##2 te4 ##2 te5). The first operand sequence
requires that first te1 evaluates to true followed by te2 two clock ticks later. The second sequence requires
that first te3 evaluates to true followed by te4 two clock ticks later, followed by te5 two clock ticks later.
This attempt results in a match because both operand sequences match. The end times of matches for the
individual sequences are clock ticks 10 and 12. The end time for the composite sequence is the later of the
two end times; therefore, a match is recognized for the composite sequence at clock tick 12.
In the following example, the first operand sequence has a concatenation operator with range from 1 to 5:
(te1 ##[1:5] te2) and (te3 ##2 te4 ##2 te5)
The first operand sequence requires that te1 evaluate to true and that te2 evaluate to true 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
clock ticks later. The second operand sequence is the same as in the previous example. To consider all
possibilities of a match of the composite sequence, the following steps can be taken:
a)
Five threads of evaluation are started for the five possible linear sequences associated with the first
sequence operand.
b)
The second operand sequence has only one associated linear sequence; therefore, only one thread of
evaluation is started for it.
Figure 16-5—ANDing (and) two sequences
c)
Figure 16-6 shows the evaluation attempt beginning at clock tick 8. All five linear sequences for the
first operand sequence match, as shown in a time window; therefore, there are five matches of the
first operand sequence, ending at clock ticks 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, respectively. The second operand
sequence matches at clock tick 12.
d)
Each match of the first operand sequence is combined with the single match of the second operand
sequence, and the rules of the AND operation determine the end time of the resulting match of the
composite sequence.

The result of this computation is five matches of the composite sequence, four of them ending at clock tick
12, and the fifth ending at clock tick 13. Figure 16-6 shows the matches of the composite sequence ending at
clock ticks 12 and 13.
If te1 and te2 are sampled expressions (not sequences), the sequence (te1 and te2) matches if te1 and
te2 both evaluate to true.
An example is illustrated in Figure 16-7, which shows the results for attempts at every clock tick. The
sequence matches at clock tick 1, 3, 8, and 14 because both te1 and te2 are simultaneously true. At all
other clock ticks, match of the AND operation fails because either te1 or te2 is false.

Syntax 16-8—Intersect operator syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The two operands of intersect are sequences. The requirements for match of the intersect operation
are as follows:
—
Both the operands shall match.
—
The lengths of the two matches of the operand sequences shall be the same.
The additional requirement on the length of the sequences is the basic difference between and and
intersect.
An attempted evaluation of an intersect sequence can result in multiple matches. The results of such an
attempt can be computed as follows:
—
Matches of the first and second operands that are of the same length are paired. Each such pair
results in a match of the composite sequence, with length and match point equal to the shared length
and match point of the paired matches of the operand sequences.
—
If no such pair is found, then there is no match of the composite sequence.
Figure 16-8 is similar to Figure 16-6, except that and is replaced by intersect. In this case, unlike in
Figure 16-6, there is only a single match at clock tick 12.

Syntax 16-9—Or operator syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The two operands of or are sequences.
If the operands te1 and te2 are expressions, then
te1 or te2
matches at any clock tick on which at least one of te1 and te2 evaluates to true.
Figure 16-9 illustrates an OR operation for which the operands te1 and te2 are expressions. The composite
sequence does not match at clock ticks 7 and 13 because te1 and te2 are both false at those times. At all
other clock ticks, the composite sequence matches, as at least one of the two operands evaluates to true.
Figure 16-9—ORing (or) two Boolean expressions
When te1 and te2 are sequences, then the sequence
te1 or te2
matches if at least one of the two operand sequences te1 and te2 matches. Each match of either te1 or te2
constitutes a match of the composite sequence, and its end time as a match of the composite sequence is the
same as its end time as a match of te1 or of te2. In other words, the set of matches of te1 or te2 is the
union of the set of matches of te1 with the set of matches of te2.
The following example shows a sequence with operator or where the two operands are sequences.
Figure 16-10 illustrates this example.
(te1 ##2 te2) or (te3 ##2 te4 ##2 te5)
The two operand sequences in the preceding example are (te1 ##2 te2) and (te3 ##2 te4 ##2 te5).
The first sequence requires that te1 first evaluates to true, followed by te2 two clock ticks later. The second
sequence requires that te3 evaluates to true, followed by te4 two clock ticks later, followed by te5 two
clock ticks later. In Figure 16-10, the evaluation attempt for clock tick 8 is shown. The first sequence
matches at clock tick 10, and the second sequence matches at clock tick 12. Therefore, two matches for the
composite sequence are recognized.

In the following example, the first operand sequence has a concatenation operator with range from 1 to 5:
(te1 ##[1:5] te2) or (te3 ##2 te4 ##2 te5)
The first operand sequence requires that te1 evaluate to true and that te2 evaluate to true 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
clock ticks later. The second operand sequence requires that te3 evaluate to true, that te4 evaluate to true
two clock ticks later, and that te5 evaluate to true another two clock ticks later. The composite sequence
matches at any clock tick on which at least one of the operand sequences matches. As shown in
Figure 16-11, for the attempt at clock tick 8, the first operand sequence matches at clock ticks 9, 10, 11, 12,
and 13, while the second operand matches at clock tick 12. The composite sequence, therefore, has one
match at each of clock ticks 9, 10, 11, and 13 and has two matches at clock tick 12.

#### 16.9.8 First_match operation

The first_match operator matches only the first of possibly multiple matches for an evaluation attempt of
its operand sequence. This allows all subsequent matches to be discarded from consideration. In particular,
when a sequence is a subsequence of a larger sequence, then applying the first_match operator has
significant effect on the evaluation of the enclosing sequence (see Syntax 16-10).
```ebnf

// from A.2.10
...
| first_match ( sequence_expr { , sequence_match_item } )
Syntax 16-10—First_match operator syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
An evaluation attempt of first_match (seq) results in an evaluation attempt for the operand seq beginning
at the same clock tick. If the evaluation attempt for seq produces no match, then the evaluation attempt for
first_match (seq) produces no match. Otherwise, the match of seq with the earliest ending clock tick is a
match of first_match (seq). If there are multiple matches of seq with the same ending clock tick as the
earliest one, then all those matches are matches of first_match (seq).
The following example shows a variable delay specification:
sequence t1;
te1 ## [2:5] te2;

sequence ts1;
first_match(te1 ## [2:5] te2);

Here, te1 and te2 are expressions. Each attempt of sequence t1 can result in matches for up to four of the
following sequences:
te1 ##2 te2
te1 ##3 te2
te1 ##4 te2
te1 ##5 te2
However, sequence ts1 can result in a match for only one of the preceding four sequences. Whichever
match of the preceding four sequences ends first is a match of sequence ts1.
For example:
sequence t2;
(a ##[2:3] b) or (c ##[1:2] d);
endsequence
sequence ts2;
first_match(t2);
endsequence
Each attempt of sequence t2 can result in matches for up to four of the following sequences:
a ##2 b
a ##3 b
c ##1 d
c ##2 d
Sequence ts2 matches only the earliest ending match of these sequences. If a, b, c, and d are expressions,
then it is possible to have matches ending at the same time for both.
a ##2 b
c ##2 d
If both of these sequences match and (c ##1 d) does not match, then evaluation of ts2 results in these two
matches.
Sequence match items can be attached to the operand sequence of the first_match operator. The sequence
match items are placed within the same set of parentheses that enclose the operand. Thus, for example, the
local variable assignment x = e can be attached to the first match of seq via
first_match(seq, x = e)
which is equivalent to the following:
first_match((seq, x = e))
See 16.10 and 16.11 for discussion of sequence match items.
#### 16.9.9 Conditions over sequences

Sequences often occur under the assumptions of some conditions for correct behavior. A logical condition is
required to hold true, for instance, while processing a transaction. Also, occurrence of certain values is
prohibited while processing a transaction. Such situations can be expressed directly using the construct
shown in Syntax 16-11.

| expression_or_dist throughout sequence_expr
Syntax 16-11—Throughout construct syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The construct exp throughout seq is an abbreviation for the following:
(exp) [*0:$] intersect seq
The composite sequence, exp throughout seq, matches along a finite interval of consecutive clock ticks
provided seq matches along the interval and exp evaluates to true at each clock tick of the interval.
The following example is illustrated in Figure 16-12.
sequence burst_rule1;
@(posedge mclk)
$fell(burst_mode) ##0
((!burst_mode) throughout (##2 ((trdy==0)&&(irdy==0)) [*7]));
endsequence
Figure 16-12—Match with throughout restriction fails
Figure 16-13 illustrates the evaluation attempt for sequence burst_rule1 beginning at clock tick 2.
Because signal burst_mode is high at clock tick 1 and low at clock tick 2, $fell(burst_mode) is true at
clock tick 2. To complete the match of burst_rule1, the value of burst_mode is required to be low
throughout a match of the subsequence (##2 ((trdy==0)&&(irdy==0)) [*7]) beginning at clock tick 2.
This subsequence matches from clock tick 2 to clock tick 10. However, at clock tick 9 burst_mode
becomes high, thereby failing to match according to the rules for throughout.
If signal burst_mode were instead to remain low through at least clock tick 10, then there would be a match
of burst_rule1 from clock tick 2 to clock tick 10, as shown in Figure 16-13.

The containment of a sequence within another sequence is expressed as follows in Syntax 16-12.
```ebnf
sequence_expr ::=
```

// from A.2.10
...
| sequence_expr within sequence_expr
Syntax 16-12—Within construct syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The construct seq1 within seq2 is an abbreviation for the following:
(1[*0:$] ##1 seq1 ##1 1[*0:$]) intersect seq2
The composite sequence seq1 within seq2 matches along a finite interval of consecutive clock ticks
provided seq2 matches along the interval and seq1 matches along some subinterval of consecutive clock
ticks. In other words, the matches of seq1 and seq2 shall satisfy the following:
—
The start point of the match of seq1 shall be no earlier than the start point of the match of seq2.
—
The match point of seq1 shall be no later than the match point of seq2.
For example, the sequence
!trdy[*7] within ($fell(irdy) ##1 !irdy[*8])
matches from clock tick 3 to clock tick 11 on the trace shown in Figure 16-13.
#### 16.9.11 Composing sequences from simpler subsequences

There are two ways in which a complex sequence can be composed using simpler subsequences.
One is to instantiate a named sequence by referencing its name. Evaluation of such a reference requires the
named sequence to match starting from the clock tick at which the reference is reached during the evaluation
of the enclosing sequence. For example:
## 1      2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9      10     11     12     13     14

sequence s;
a ##1 b ##1 c;
endsequence
sequence rule;
@(posedge sysclk)
trans ##1 start_trans ##1 s ##1 end_trans;
endsequence
Sequence s is evaluated beginning one tick after the evaluation of start_trans in the sequence rule.
Another way to use a sequence is to detect its end point in another sequence. The reaching of the end point
(see 16.7) can be tested by using the method triggered.
To detect the end point, the triggered method may be applied to a named sequence instance, with or
without arguments, an untyped formal argument, or a formal argument of type sequence, where such is
allowed, as follows:
sequence_instance.triggered
or
formal_argument_sequence.triggered
triggered is a method on a sequence. The result of its operation is true (1'b1) or false (1'b0) . When
method triggered is evaluated in an expression, it tests whether its operand sequence has reached its end
point at that particular point in time. The result of triggered does not depend upon the starting point of the
match of its operand sequence. An example is shown as follows:
sequence e1;
@(posedge sysclk) $rose(ready) ##1 proc1 ##1 proc2 ;
endsequence
sequence rule;
@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 inst ##1 e1.triggered ##1 branch_back;
endsequence
In this example, sequence e1 is required to match one clock tick after inst. If the method triggered is
replaced with an instance of sequence e1, a match of e1 is required to start one clock tick after inst. Notice
that method triggered only tests for the end point of e1 and has no bearing on the starting point of e1.
The following example demonstrates an application of the method triggered on a named sequence
instance with arguments:
sequence e2(a,b,c);
@(posedge sysclk) $rose(a) ##1 b ##1 c;
endsequence
sequence rule2;
@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 inst ##1 e2(ready,proc1,proc2).triggered
##1 branch_back;
endsequence
rule2 is equivalent to rule2a as follows:
sequence e2_instantiated;
e2(ready,proc1,proc2);
endsequence
sequence rule2a;

@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 inst ##1 e2_instantiated.triggered ##1
branch_back;
endsequence
The following example demonstrates an application of method triggered on a formal argument of type
sequence:
sequence e3(sequence a, untyped b);
@(posedge sysclk) a.triggered ##1 b;
endsequence
sequence rule3;
@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 e3(ready ##1 proc1, proc2) ##1 branch_back;
endsequence
There are additional restrictions on passing local variables into an instance of a sequence to which
triggered is applied (see 16.10).
The method triggered can be used in the presence of multiple clocks. However, the ending clock of the
sequence instance to which triggered is applied shall always be the same as the clock in the context where
the application of method triggered appears (see 16.13.5).
If a sequence admits an empty match, such empty matches shall not activate the .triggered method. For
example, consider the following sequence, which admits both empty and nonempty matches:
sequence zero_or_one_req;
(req==1'b1)[*0:1];
endsequence
The method zero_or_one_req.triggered() will only return true (1'b1) when the sampled value of
req is 1'b1, resulting in a nonempty match.
### 16.10 Local variables

Data can be manipulated within named sequences (see 16.8) and properties (see 16.12) using dynamically
created local variables. The use of a static SystemVerilog variable implies that only one copy exists. If data
values need to be checked in pipelined designs, then for each quantum of data entering the pipeline, a
separate variable can be used to store the predicted output of the pipeline for later comparison when the
result actually exits the pipe. This storage can be built by using an array of variables arranged in a shift
register to mimic the data propagating through the pipeline. However, in more complex situations where the
latency of the pipe is variable and out of order, this construction could become very complex and error
prone. Therefore, variables are needed that are local to and are used within a particular transaction check that
can span an arbitrary interval of time and can overlap with other transaction checks. Such a variable will
thus be dynamically created when needed within an instance of a sequence and removed when the end of the
sequence is reached.
The dynamic creation of a local variable and its assignment is achieved by either using a local variable
formal argument declaration (see 16.8.2, 16.12.18) or using an assertion variable declaration within the
declaration of a named sequence or property (see 16.12). Without further specification, the term local
variable shall mean either a local variable formal argument or a local variable declared in an
assertion_variable_declaration. Without further specification, the term local variable initialization
assignment shall mean either an initialization assignment to a local variable formal argument of direction
input or inout of the value of the corresponding actual argument or a declaration assignment to a local
variable declared in an assertion_variable_declaration (see Syntax 16-13).

```

// from A.2.10
Syntax 16-13—Assertion variable declaration syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The data type of an assertion variable declaration shall be specified explicitly. The data type shall be one of
the types allowed within assertions as defined in 16.6. The data type shall be followed by a comma-
separated list of one or more identifiers with optional declaration assignments. A declaration assignment, if
present, defines the initial value to be placed in the corresponding local variable. The initial value is defined
by an expression, which need not be constant.
The sampled value of a local variable is defined as the current value (see 16.5.1).
At the beginning of each evaluation attempt of an instance of a named sequence or property, a new copy of
each of its local variables shall be created and, if present, the corresponding initialization assignment shall
be performed. Initialization assignments shall be performed in the Observed region in the order that they
appear in the sequence or property declaration. For the purposes of this rule, all initialization assignments to
local variable formal arguments shall be performed before any initialization assignment to a local variable
declared in an assertion_variable_declaration. An initialization assignment to a local variable uses the
sampled value of its expression in the time slot in which the evaluation attempt begins. The expression of an
initialization assignment to a given local variable may refer to a previously declared local variable. In this
case the previously declared local variable shall itself have an initialization assignment, and the initial value
assigned to the previously declared local variable shall be used in the evaluation of the expression assigned
to the given local variable. Local variables do not have default initial values. A local variable without an
initialization assignment shall be unassigned at the beginning of the evaluation attempt.
For example, at the beginning of an evaluation attempt of an instance of
sequence s;
logic u, v = a, w = v || b;
...
endsequence
the assignment of a to v is performed first, and the assignment of v || b to w is performed second. The
value assigned to w is the same as would result from the declaration assignment w = a || b. The local
variable u is unassigned at the beginning of the evaluation attempt.
Local variables may be assigned and reassigned within the body of the sequence or property in which they
are declared.

One or more local variables may be assigned at the end point of a syntactic subsequence by placing the
subsequence, comma-separated from the list of local variable assignments, in parentheses. At the end of any
nonempty match of the subsequence, the local variable assignments are performed in the order that they
appear in the list. For example, if in
a ##1 b[->1] ##1 c[*2]
it is desired to assign x = e and then y = x && f at the match of b[->1], the sequence can be rewritten as
a ##1 (b[->1], x = e, y = x && f) ##1 c[*2]
A local variable may be reassigned later in the sequence or property, as in
a ##1 (b[->1], x = e, y = x && f) ##1 (c[*2], x &= g)
The subsequence to which a local variable assignment is attached shall not admit an empty match (see
16.12.22). For example, the sequence
a ##1 (b[*0:1], x = e) ##1 c[*2] // illegal
is illegal because the subsequence b[*0:1] can match the empty word. The sequence
(a ##1 b[*0:1], x = e) ##1 c[*2] // legal
is legal because the concatenated subsequence a ##1 b[*0:1] cannot match the empty word.
A local variable may be referenced within the sequence or property in which it is declared. The sequence or
property shall assign a value to the local variable prior to the point at which the reference is made. The prior
assignment may be an initialization assignment or an assignment attached to a subsequence. There is an
implicit reference associated with the use of an inc_or_dec_operator or an assignment operator other than
“=”. Therefore, a local variable shall be assigned a value prior to being updated with an
inc_or_dec_operator or with an assignment operator other than “=”.
Under certain circumstances, a local variable that is assigned later becomes unassigned. If a local variable
does not flow out of a subsequence (see the following), then the local variable shall become unassigned at
the end of that subsequence, regardless of whether it was assigned a value prior to that point. The local
variable shall not be referenced after the point from which it does not flow until after it has again been
assigned a value. See F.5.4 for precise conditions defining local variable flow.
Hierarchical references to a local variable are not allowed.
As an example of local variable usage, assume a pipeline that has a fixed latency of five clock cycles. The
data enter the pipe on pipe_in when valid_in is true, and the value computed by the pipeline appears five
clock cycles later on the signal pipe_out1. The data as transformed by the pipe are predicted by a function
that increments the data. The following property verifies this behavior:
property e;
int x;
(valid_in, x = pipe_in) |-> ##5 (pipe_out1 == (x+1));
endproperty
Property e is evaluated as follows:
—
When valid_in is true, x is assigned the value of pipe_in. If five cycles later, pipe_out1 is
equal to x+1, then property e is true. Otherwise, property e is false.

435
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
—
When valid_in is false, property e evaluates to true.
A local variable can be used to form expressions in the same way that a static variable of the same type can
be used. This includes the use of local variables in expressions for bit-selects and part-selects of vectors or
for indices of arrays. A local variable shall not be used in a clocking event expression.
Local variables may be used in sequences or properties.
sequence data_check;
int x;
a ##1 (!a, x = data_in) ##1 !b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == x);
endsequence
property data_check_p
int x;
a ##1 (!a, x = data_in) |=> !b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == x);
endproperty
Local variable assignments may be attached to the operand sequence of a repetition and accomplish
accumulation of values.
sequence rep_v;
int x = 0;
(a[->1], x += data)[*4] ##1 b ##1 c && (data_out == x);
endsequence
An accumulating local variable may be used to count the number of times a condition is repeated, as in the
following example:
sequence count_a_cycles;
int x;
($rose(a), x = 1)
##1 (a, x++)[*0:$]
##1 !a && (x <= MAX);
endsequence
The local variables declared within a sequence or property are not visible in the context where the sequence
or property is instantiated. The following example illustrates an illegal access to local variable v1 of
sequence sub_seq1 in sequence seq1.
sequence sub_seq1;
int v1;
(a ##1 !a, v1 = data_in) ##1 !b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == v1);
endsequence
sequence seq1;
c ##1 sub_seq1 ##1 (do1 == v1); // error because v1 is not visible
endsequence
It can be useful to assign a value to a local variable within an instance of a named sequence and reference the
local variable in the instantiating context at or after the completion of a match of the instance. The rules for
assigning values to a local variable within an instance of a named sequence are described in 16.8.2. This
capability is also supported under the following conditions:
—
The local variable shall be declared outside the named sequence, and its scope shall include both the
instance of the named sequence and the desired reference in the instantiating context.
—
The local variable shall be passed as an entire actual argument in the list of arguments of the
instance of the named sequence.

—
The corresponding formal argument shall be untyped.
The named sequence may specify assignments to the formal argument in one or more
sequence_match_items.
The following example illustrates this usage:
sequence sub_seq2(lv);
(a ##1 !a, lv = data_in) ##1 !b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == lv);
endsequence
sequence seq2;
int v1;
c ##1 sub_seq2(v1)
// v1 is bound to lv
##1 (do1 == v1);
// v1 holds the value that was assigned to lv
endsequence
An alternative way to achieve a similar capability is by using local variable formal arguments (see 16.8.2).
Local variables can be passed into an instance of a named sequence to which triggered is applied and
accessed in a similar manner. For example:
sequence seq2a;
int v1; c ##1 sub_seq2(v1).triggered ##1 (do1 == v1);
// v1 is now bound to lv
endsequence
There are additional restrictions when passing local variables into an instance of a named sequence to which
triggered is applied:
—
Local variables can be passed in only as entire actual arguments, not as proper subexpressions of
actual arguments.
—
In the declaration of the named sequence, the formal argument to which the local variable is bound
shall not be referenced before it is assigned.
The second restriction is met by sub_seq2 because the assignment lv = data_in occurs before the
reference to lv in data_out == lv.
If a local variable is assigned before being passed into an instance of a named sequence to which
triggered is applied, then the restrictions prevent this assigned value from being visible within the named
sequence. The restrictions are important because the use of triggered means that there is no guaranteed
relationship between the point in time at which the local variable is assigned outside the named sequence
and the beginning of the match of the instance.
A local variable that is passed in as actual argument to an instance of a named sequence to which
triggered is applied will flow out of the application of triggered to that instance provided both of the
following conditions are met:
—
The local variable flows out of the end of the named sequence instance, as defined by the local
variable flow rules for sequences. (See the following and F.5.4.)
—
The application of triggered to this instance is a maximal Boolean expression. In other words, the
application of triggered cannot have negation or any other expression operator applied to it.
Both conditions are satisfied by sub_seq2 and seq2a. Thus, in seq2a, the value in v1 in the comparison
do1 == v1 is the value assigned to lv in sub_seq2 by the assignment lv = data_in. However, in
sequence seq2b;

   int v1; c ##1 !sub_seq2(v1).triggered ##1 (do1 == v1); // v1 unassigned
endsequence
the second condition is violated because of the negation applied to sub_seq2(v1).triggered. Therefore,
v1 does not flow out of the application of triggered to this instance, and the reference to v1 in do1 ==
v1 is to an unassigned variable.
In a single cycle, there can be multiple matches of a sequence instance to which triggered is applied, and
these matches can have different valuations of the local variables. The multiple matches are treated
semantically the same way as matching both disjuncts of an or (see the following). In other words, the
thread evaluating the instance to which triggered is applied will fork to account for such distinct local
variable valuations.
When a local variable is a formal argument of a sequence declaration, it is illegal to declare the variable, as
shown in the following example:
sequence sub_seq3(lv);
int lv; // illegal because lv is a formal argument
(a ##1 !a, lv = data_in) ##1 !b[*0:$] ##1 b && (data_out == lv);
endsequence
There are special considerations when using local variables in sequences involving the branching operators
or, and, and intersect. The evaluation of a composite sequence constructed from one of these operators
can be thought of as forking two threads to evaluate the operand sequences in parallel. A local variable may
have been assigned a value before the start of the evaluation of the composite sequence, either from an
initialization assignment or from an assignment attached to a preceding subsequence. Such a local variable
is said to flow in to each of the operand sequences. The local variable may be assigned or reassigned in one
or both of the operand sequences. In general, there is no guarantee that evaluation of the two threads results
in consistent values for the local variable, or even that there is a consistent view of whether the local variable
has been assigned a value. Therefore, the values assigned to the local variable before and during the
evaluation of the composite sequence are not always allowed to be visible after the evaluation of the
composite sequence.
In some cases, inconsistency in the view of the local variable’s value does not matter, while in others it does.
Precise conditions are given in F.5.4 to define static (i.e., compile-time computable) conditions under which
a sufficiently consistent view of the local variable’s value after the evaluation of the composite sequence is
provided. If these conditions are satisfied, then the local variable is said to flow out of the composite
sequence. Otherwise, the local variable shall become unassigned at the end of the composite sequence. An
intuitive description of the conditions for local variable flow follows:
a)
Variables assigned on parallel threads cannot be accessed in sibling threads. For example:
sequence s4;
 int x;
 (a ##1 (b, x = data) ##1 c) or (d ##1 (e==x)); // illegal
endsequence
b)
In the case of or, a local variable flows out of the composite sequence if, and only if, it flows out of
each of the operand sequences. If the local variable is not assigned before the start of the composite
sequence and it is assigned in only one of the operand sequences, then it does not flow out of the
composite sequence.
c)
Each thread for an operand of an or that matches its operand sequence continues as a separate
thread, carrying with it its own latest assignments to the local variables that flow out of the
composite sequence. These threads do not have to have consistent valuations for the local variables.
For example:
sequence s5;
int x,y;

((a ##1 (b, x = data, y = data1) ##1 c)
or (d ##1 (`true, x = data) ##0 (e==x))) ##1 (y==data2);
// illegal because y is not in the intersection
endsequence
sequence s6;
int x,y;
((a ##1 (b, x = data, y = data1) ##1 c)
or (d ##1 (`true, x = data) ##0 (e==x))) ##1 (x==data2);
// legal because x is in the intersection
endsequence
d)
In the case of and and intersect, a local variable that flows out of at least one operand shall flow
out of the composite sequence unless it is blocked. A local variable is blocked from flowing out of
the composite sequence if either of the following statements applies:
1)
The local variable is assigned in and flows out of each operand of the composite sequence, or
2)
The local variable is blocked from flowing out of at least one of the operand sequences.
The value of a local variable that flows out of the composite sequence is the latest assigned value.
The threads for the two operands are merged into one at completion of evaluation of the composite
sequence.
sequence s7;
int x,y;
((a ##1 (b, x = data, y = data1) ##1 c)
and (d ##1 (`true, x = data) ##0 (e==x))) ##1 (x==data2);
// illegal because x is common to both threads
endsequence
sequence s8;
int x,y;
((a ##1 (b, x = data, y = data1) ##1 c)
and (d ##1 (`true, x = data) ##0 (e==x))) ##1 (y==data2);
// legal because y is in the difference
endsequence
### 16.11 Calling subroutines on match of a sequence

Tasks, task methods, void functions, void function methods, and system tasks can be called at the end of a
successful nonempty match of a sequence. The subroutine calls, like local variable assignments, appear in
the comma-separated list that follows the sequence. The subroutine calls are said to be attached to the
sequence. It shall be an error to attach a subroutine call or any sequence_match_item to a sequence that
admits an empty match (see 16.12.22). The sequence and the list that follows are enclosed in parentheses
(see Syntax 16-15).

For example:
sequence s1;
logic v, w;
(a, v = e) ##1
(b[->1], w = f, $display("b after a with v = %h, w = %h\n", v, w));
endsequence
defines a sequence s1 that matches at the first occurrence of b strictly after an occurrence of a. At the match,
the system task $display is executed to write a message that announces the match and shows the values
assigned to the local variables v and w.
All subroutine calls attached to a sequence are executed at every end point of the sequence. For each end
point, the attached calls are executed in the order they appear in the list. Assertion evaluation does not wait
on or receive data back from any attached subroutine. The subroutines are scheduled in the Reactive region,
like an action block.
Each argument of a subroutine call attached to a sequence shall either be passed by value as an input or be
passed by reference (either ref or const ref; see 13.5.2). Actual argument expressions that are passed by
value use sampled values of the underlying variables and are consistent with the variable values used to
evaluate the sequence match. The variable passed by value as an input shall be of a type allowed in 16.6.  An
automatic variable may be passed as a constant input for a subroutine call from an assertion statement in
procedural code (see 16.14.6.1). An automatic variable shall not be passed by reference nor passed as a non-
constant input to a subroutine call from an assertion statement in procedural code. The rules for passing
elements of dynamic arrays, queues, and associative arrays as ref arguments are described in 13.5.2.
Local variables can be passed into subroutine calls attached to a sequence. Any local variable that flows out
of the sequence or that is assigned in the list following the sequence, but before the subroutine call, can be
used in an actual argument expression for the call. If a local variable appears in an actual argument
expression, then that argument shall be passed by value.
### 16.12 Declaring properties

A property defines a behavior of the design. A named property may be used for verification as an
assumption, an obligation, or a coverage specification. In order to use the behavior for verification, an
assert, assume, or cover statement needs to be used. A property declaration by itself does not produce
any result.
A named property may be declared in any of the following:
—
A module
—
An interface
—
A program
—
A clocking block
—
A package
—
A compilation-unit scope
—
A generate block
—
A checker
To declare a named property, the property construct is used as shown in Syntax 16-16.

Syntax 16-16—Property construct syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
A named property may be declared with formal arguments in the optional property_port_list.
Except as described in 16.12.18, 16.12.19, and 16.12.17, the rules for declaring formal arguments and
default actual arguments in named properties and for instantiating named properties with actual arguments
are the same as those for named sequences as described in 16.8, 16.8.1, and 16.8.2.
Rules particular to the specification and use of typed formal arguments in named properties are discussed in
16.12.18.
Rules particular to the specification and use of local variable formal arguments in named properties are
discussed in 16.12.19.
A formal argument may be referenced in the body property_spec of the declaration of the named property. A
reference to a formal argument may be written in place of various syntactic entities, including, in addition to
those listed in 16.8, the following:
—
property_expr
—
property_spec
A named property may be instantiated prior to its declaration. A named property may be instantiated
anywhere a property_spec may be written. A named property may be instantiated in a place where a
property_expr may be written provided the instance does not produce an illegal disable iff clause (see
the following). There may be cyclic dependencies among named properties resulting from their
instantiations. A cyclic dependency among named properties results if, and only if, there is a cycle in the
directed graph whose nodes are the named properties and whose edges are defined by the following rule:
there is a directed edge from one named property to a second named property if, and only if, either the first
named property instantiates the second named property within its declaration, including an instance within
the declaration of a default actual argument, or there is an instance of the first named property that
instantiates the second named property within an actual argument. Named properties with such cyclic
dependencies are called recursive and are discussed in 16.12.17.
The terminal $ may be an actual argument to an instance of a named property, either declared as a default
actual argument or passed in the list of arguments of the instance. If $ is an actual argument to an instance of
a named property, then the corresponding formal argument shall be untyped and each of its references either

shall be an upper bound in a cycle_delay_const_range_expression or shall itself be an actual argument in an
instance of a named sequence or property.
The behavior and semantics of an instance of a nonrecursive named property are the same as those of the
flattened property that is obtained from the body of the declaration of the named property by the rewriting
algorithm defined in F.4.1. The rewriting algorithm substitutes actual arguments for references to the
corresponding formal arguments in the body of the declaration of the named property. The rewriting
algorithm does not itself account for name resolution and assumes that names have been resolved prior to the
substitution of actual arguments. If the flattened property is not legal, then the instance is not legal and there
shall be an error.
The result of property evaluation is either true or false. Properties may be built from other properties or
sequences using instantiation and the operators described in the following subclauses.
Table 16-3 lists the sequence and property operators from highest to lowest precedence and shows the
associativity of the non-unary operators. The precedence for the strong and weak sequence operators is not
defined because these operators require parentheses. The operators described in Table 11-2 have higher
precedence than the sequence and property operators.

A disable iff clause can be attached to a property_expr to yield a property_spec.
disable iff (expression_or_dist) property_expr
The expression of the disable iff is called the disable condition. The disable iff clause allows
preemptive resets to be specified. For an evaluation of the property_spec, there is an evaluation of the
underlying property_expr. If the disable condition is true at anytime between the start of the attempt in the
Observed region, inclusive, and the end of the evaluation attempt, inclusive, then the overall evaluation of

the property results in disabled. A property has disabled evaluation if it was preempted due to a
disable iff condition. A disabled evaluation of a property does not result in success or failure.
Otherwise, the evaluation of the property_spec is the same as that of the property_expr. The disable
condition is tested independently for different evaluation attempts of the property_spec. The values of
variables used in the disable condition are those in the current simulation cycle, i.e., not sampled. The
expression may contain a reference to an end point of a sequence by using the method triggered of that
sequence. The disable conditions shall not contain any reference to local variables or the sequence method
matched. If a sampled value function other than $sampled is used in the disable condition, the sampling
clock shall be explicitly specified in its actual argument list as described in 16.9.3. Nesting of disable iff
clauses, explicitly or through property instantiations, is not allowed.
#### 16.12.1 Property instantiation

An instance of a named property can be used as a property_expr or property_spec. In general, the instance is
legal provided the body property_spec of the named property can be substituted in place of the instance,
with actual arguments substituted for formal arguments, and result in a legal property_expr or
property_spec. For example, if an instance of a named property is used as a property_expr operand for any
property-building operator, then the named property may not have a disable iff clause.
#### 16.12.2 Sequence property

Sequence
properties
have
three
forms:
sequence_expr,
weak(sequence_expr),
and
strong(sequence_expr). The
strong and
weak operators are called sequence operators.
strong(sequence_expr) evaluates to true if, and only if, there is a nonempty match of the sequence_expr.
weak(sequence_expr) evaluates to true if, and only if, there is no finite prefix that witnesses inability to
match the sequence_expr. The sequence_expr of a sequential property shall not admit an empty match (see
16.12.22).
If the strong or weak operator is omitted, then the evaluation of the sequence_expr depends on the
assertion statement in which it is used. If the assertion statement is assert property or
assume property, then the sequence_expr is evaluated as weak(sequence_expr). Otherwise, the
sequence_expr is evaluated as strong(sequence_expr).
NOTE—The semantics for a sequence_expr definition in IEEE Std 1800-2009 and on is not backward compatible with
IEEE Std 1800-2005. The current equivalent to a sequence_expr as defined in IEEE Std 1800-2005 is
strong(sequence_expr).
Since only one match of a sequence_expr is needed for strong(sequence_expr) to hold, a property of the
form
strong(sequence_expr)
evaluates
to
true
if,
and
only
if,
the
property
strong(first_match(sequence_expr)) evaluates to true.
Similarly, a property of the form weak(sequence_expr) evaluates to true if, and only if, the property
weak(first_match(sequence_expr)) evaluates to true. This is because a prefix witnesses inability to
match sequence_expr if, and only if, it witnesses inability to match first_match(sequence_expr).
The following examples illustrate the sequential property forms:
property p3;
b ##1 c;
endproperty
c1: cover property (@(posedge clk) a #-# p3);
a1: assert property (@(posedge clk) a |-> p3);

IEEE Std 1800-2023
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
444
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
The sequential property p3 is interpreted as strong in the cover property c1. An evaluation attempt of c1
returns true if, and only if, a is true at the tick of posedge clk at which the attempt begins and both of the
following conditions are satisfied:
—
b is true at the tick of posedge clk at which the attempt begins.
—
There exists a subsequent tick of posedge clk and c is true at the first such tick.
The sequential property p3 is interpreted as weak in the assert property a1. An evaluation attempt of a1
returns true if, and only if, either a is false at the tick of posedge clk at which the attempt begins or both of
the following conditions are satisfied:
—
b is true at the tick of posedge clk at which the attempt begins.
—
If there exists a subsequent tick of posedge clk, then c is true at the first such tick.
#### 16.12.3 Negation property

A property is a negation if it has the form not property_expr. For each evaluation attempt of the property,
there is an evaluation attempt of property_expr. The keyword not states that the evaluation of the property
returns the opposite of the evaluation of the underlying property_expr. Thus, if property_expr evaluates to
true, then not property_expr evaluates to false; and if property_expr evaluates to false, then not
property_expr evaluates to true.
The not operator switches the strength of a property. In particular, one should be careful when negating a
sequence. For example, consider the following assertion:
a1: assert property (@clk not a ##1 b);
Since the sequential property a ##1 b is used in an assertion, it is weak. This means that if clk stops
ticking and a holds at the last tick of clk, the weak sequential property a ##1 b will also hold beginning at
that tick, and so the assertion a1 will fail. In this case it is more reasonable to use:
a2: assert property (@clk not strong(a ##1 b));
#### 16.12.4 Disjunction property

A property is a disjunction if it has the following form:
property_expr1 or property_expr2
The property evaluates to true if, and only if, at least one of property_expr1 and property_expr2 evaluates to
true.
#### 16.12.5 Conjunction property

A property is a conjunction if it has the following form:
property_expr1 and property_expr2
The property evaluates to true if, and only if, both property_expr1 and property_expr2 evaluate to true.
#### 16.12.6 If-else property

A property is an if–else if it has one of the following forms:
if ( expression_or_dist ) property_expr
if ( expression_or_dist ) property_expr1 else property_expr2

A property of the first form evaluates to true if, and only if, either expression_or_dist evaluates to false or
property_expr evaluates to true. A property of the second form evaluates to true if, and only if, either
expression_or_dist evaluates to true and property_expr1 evaluates to true or expression_or_dist evaluates to
false and property_expr2 evaluates to true.
#### 16.12.7 Implication

The implication construct specifies that the checking of a property is performed conditionally on the match
of a sequential antecedent.
A property is an implication if it has one of the following forms:
sequence_expr |-> property_expr
sequence_expr |=> property_expr
This construct is used to precondition monitoring of a property expression and is allowed at the property
level. The result of the implication is either true or false. The left-hand operand sequence_expr is called the
antecedent, while the right-hand operand property_expr is called the consequent.
The following points should be noted for |-> implication:
—
From a given start point, the antecedent sequence_expr can have zero, one, or more than one
successful match.
—
If there is no match of the antecedent sequence_expr from a given start point, then evaluation of the
implication from that start point succeeds and returns true.
—
For each successful match of the antecedent sequence_expr, the consequent property_expr is
separately evaluated. The end point of the match of the antecedent sequence_expr is the start point
of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr.
—
From a given start point, evaluation of the implication succeeds and returns true if, and only if, for
every match of the antecedent sequence_expr beginning at the start point, the evaluation of the
consequent property_expr beginning at the end point of the match succeeds and returns true.
Two forms of implication are provided: overlapped using operator |-> and nonoverlapped using operator
|=>. For overlapped implication, if there is a match for the antecedent sequence_expr, then the end point of
the match is the start point of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr. For nonoverlapped
implication, the evaluation of the consequent is described by two cases, depending on whether the
implication is triggered by a nonempty match or by an empty match:
—
If triggered by a nonempty match, the start point of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr
is the clock tick after the end point of the match.
—
If triggered by an empty match, the start point of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr is
its nearest clock tick, starting from the tick when evaluation of the sequence_expr begins. For a
singly clocked property, this coincides with the current clock tick.
Therefore,

is equivalent to the following:

The following example illustrates a bus operation for data transfer from an initiator to a target device. When
the bus enters a data transfer phase, multiple data phases can occur to transfer a block of data. During the
data transfer phase, a data phase completes on any rising clock edge on which irdy is asserted and either
trdy or stop is asserted. In this example, an asserted signal implies a value of low. The requirement for the
end of a data phase can be expressed as follows:
let ready_exp = (irdy == 0) && ($fell(trdy) || $fell(stop));
property data_end;
@(posedge mclk)
$rose(data_phase) |-> ##[1:5] ready_exp;
endproperty
a1: assert property(data_end);
Each time the sequence $rose(data_phase) matches, an evaluation of the consequent property begins. In
Figure 16-14, a match for $rose(data_phase) occurs at clock tick 2. This begins the evaluation of the
consequent property. Then, at clock tick 6, the assertion attempt evaluates to true because $fell(stop)
and irdy==0 both evaluate to true.
In another example, data_end_exp is used to verify that frame is deasserted (value high) within two clock
ticks after data_end_exp occurs. Further, it is also required that irdy is deasserted (value high) one clock
tick after frame is deasserted.

Figure 16-14—Conditional sequence matching
A property written to express this condition is as follows:
let data_end_exp = data_phase && ready_exp;
property data_end_rule1;
@(posedge mclk)
data_end_exp |-> ##[1:2] $rose(frame) ##1 $rose(irdy);
endproperty
a2: assert property(data_end_rule1);
Property data_end_rule1 first evaluates data_end_exp at every clock tick to test if its value is true. If
the value is false, then that particular attempt to evaluate data_end_rule1 is considered true. Otherwise,
the following sequence is evaluated:
##[1:2] $rose(frame) ##1 $rose(irdy)
## 1       2       3        4        5        6       7        8       9       10      11      12     13      14

that specifies looking for the rising edge of frame within two clock ticks in the future. After frame toggles
high, irdy is also required to toggle high after one clock tick. This is illustrated in Figure 16-15 for the
evaluation attempt at clock tick 6. data_end_exp is acknowledged at clock tick 6. Next, frame toggles
high at clock tick 7. Because this falls within the timing constraint imposed by [1:2], it satisfies the
sequence and continues to evaluate further. At clock tick 8, irdy is evaluated. Signal irdy transitions to
high at clock tick 8, matching the sequence specification completely for the attempt that began at clock tick
6.
Generally, assertions are associated with preconditions so that the checking is performed only under certain
specified conditions. As seen from the previous example, the |-> operator provides this capability to specify
preconditions with sequences that shall be satisfied before evaluating their consequent properties. The next
example modifies the preceding example to see the effect on the results of the assertion by removing the
precondition for the consequent. This is shown below and illustrated in Figure 16-16.

Figure 16-16—Results without the condition
The property is evaluated at every clock tick. For the evaluation at clock tick 1, the rising edge of signal
frame does not occur at clock tick 2 or 3; therefore, the property fails at clock tick 1. Similarly, there is a
failure at clock ticks 2, 3, and 4. For attempts starting at clock ticks 5 and 6, the rising edge of signal frame
at clock tick 7 allows checking further. At clock tick 8, the sequences complete according to the
specification, resulting in a match for attempts starting at clock ticks 5 and 6. All later attempts to match the
sequence fail because $rose(frame) does not occur again.
Figure 16-16 shows that removing the precondition of checking data_end_exp from the assertion causes
failures that are not relevant to the verification objective. It is important from the validation standpoint to
determine these preconditions and use them to filter out inappropriate or extraneous situations.
An example of implication where the antecedent is a sequence follows:

(a ##1 b ##1 c) |-> (d ##1 e)
If the sequence (a ##1 b ##1 c) matches, then the sequence (d ##1 e) is also required to match. On the
other hand, if the sequence (a ##1 b ##1 c) does not match, then the result is true.
Another example of implication is as follows:
property write_to_addr;
(write_en & data_valid) ##0
(write_en && (retire_address[0:4]==addr)) [*2] |->
##[3:8] write_en && !data_valid &&(write_address[0:4]==addr);
endproperty
This property can be coded alternatively as a nested implication:
property write_to_addr_nested;
(write_en & data_valid) |->
(write_en && (retire_address[0:4]==addr)) [*2] |->
##[3:8] write_en && !data_valid && (write_address[0:4]==addr);
endproperty
## 1       2        3       4        5        6        7       8        9      10      11      12     13      14

#### 16.12.8 Implies and iff properties

A property is an implies if it has the following form:
property_expr1 implies property_expr2
A property of this form evaluates to true if, and only if, either property_expr1 evaluates to false or
property_expr2 evaluates to true.
A property is an iff if it has the following form:
property_expr1 iff property_expr2
A property of this form evaluates to true if, and only if, either both property_expr1 evaluates to false and
property_expr2 evaluates to false or both property_expr1 evaluates to true and property_expr2 evaluates to
true.
#### 16.12.9 Followed-by property

A property is a followed-by if it has one of the following forms:
sequence_expr #-# property_expr
sequence_expr #=# property_expr
This clause is used to trigger monitoring of a property expression and is allowed at the property level.
The result of the followed-by is either true or false. The left-hand operand sequence_expr is called the
antecedent, while the right-hand operand property_expr is called the consequent. For the followed-by
property to succeed, the following shall hold:
—
From a given start point sequence_expr shall have at least one successful match.
—
property_expr shall be successfully evaluated starting from one of the match points of the
sequence_expr.
From a given start point, evaluation of the followed-by succeeds and returns true if, and only if, there exists
a match of the antecedent sequence_expr beginning at the start point, and the evaluation of the consequent
property_expr beginning at the tick specified by the rules in the next paragraph succeeds and returns true.
Two forms of followed-by are provided: overlapped using operator #-# and nonoverlapped using operator
#=#. For overlapped followed-by, there shall be a match for the antecedent sequence_expr, where the end
point of this match is the start point of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr. For nonoverlapped
followed-by, the evaluation of the consequent is described by two cases, depending on whether the
antecedent sequence_expr attains a nonempty match or an empty match:
—
If a nonempty match, the start point of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr is the clock
tick after the end point of the match.
—
If an empty match, the start point of the evaluation of the consequent property_expr is its nearest
clock tick, starting from the tick when evaluation of the sequence_expr begins. For a singly clocked
property, this coincides with the current clock tick.
The followed-by operators are the duals of the implication operators. Therefore, sequence_expr #-#
property_expr is equivalent to the following:
not (sequence_expr |-> not property_expr)
and sequence_expr #=# property_expr is equivalent to the following:

not (sequence_expr |=> not property_expr)
Examples:
property p1;
##[0:5] done #-# always !rst;
endproperty
property p2;
##[0:5] done #=# always !rst;
endproperty
Property p1 says that done shall be asserted at some clock tick during the first 6 clock ticks, and starting
from one of the clock ticks when done is asserted, rst shall always be low. Property p2 says that done
shall be asserted at some clock tick during the first 6 clock ticks, and starting the clock tick after one of the
clock ticks when done is asserted, rst shall always be low.
sequence_expr #-# strong(sequence_expr1) is semantically equivalent to strong(sequence_expr ##0
sequence_expr1), and sequence_expr #=# strong(sequence_expr1) is semantically equivalent to
strong(sequence_expr ##1 sequence_expr1).
A followed-by operator is especially convenient for specifying a cover property directive over a
sequence followed by a property.
#### 16.12.10 Nexttime property

A property is a nexttime if it has one of the following forms that use the nexttime operators:
—
Weak nexttime
nexttime property_expr
The weak nexttime property nexttime property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, either the
property_expr evaluates to true beginning at the next clock tick or there is no further clock tick.
—
Indexed form of weak nexttime
nexttime [ constant_expression ] property_expr
The indexed weak nexttime property nexttime [constant_expression] property_expr evaluates to
true if, and only if, either there are not constant_expression clock ticks or property_expr evaluates to
true beginning at the last of the next constant_expression clock ticks.
—
Strong nexttime
s_nexttime property_expr
The strong nexttime property s_nexttime property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, there
exists a next clock tick and property_expr evaluates to true beginning at that clock tick.
—
Indexed form of strong nexttime
s_nexttime [ constant_expression ] property_expr
The indexed strong nexttime property
s_nexttime [constant_expression] property_expr
evaluates to true if, and only if, there exist constant_expression clock ticks and property_expr
evaluates to true beginning at the last of the next constant_expression clock ticks.
The number of clock ticks given by constant_expression shall be a non-negative integer constant expression.

Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
The preceding explanations refer to the case where the nexttime property is evaluated in a time step that is a
tick of the clock of the nexttime property. When the nexttime property is evaluated in a time step that is not
a tick of the clock of the nexttime property, an alignment to the tick of the clock of the nexttime property
should be applied before the preceding description. Thus, it is more precise to say that s_nexttime[n]
property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, there exist n+1 ticks of the clock of the nexttime property,
including the current time step, and property_expr evaluates to true on the n+1 clock tick, where counting
starts at the current time step. In particular nexttime[0] and s_nexttime[0] act as alignment operators.
The comments in the following examples describe the conditions for the properties to be evaluated to true:
// if the clock ticks once more, then a shall be true at the next clock tick
property p1;
nexttime a;
endproperty
// the clock shall tick once more and a shall be true at the next clock tick.
property p2;
s_nexttime a;
endproperty
// as long as the clock ticks, a shall be true at each future clock tick
// starting from the next clock tick
property p3;
nexttime always a;
endproperty
// the clock shall tick at least once more and as long as it ticks, a shall
// be true at every clock tick starting from the next one
property p4;
s_nexttime always a;
endproperty
// if the clock ticks at least once more, it shall tick enough times for a to
// be true at some point in the future starting from the next clock tick
property p5;
nexttime s_eventually a;
endproperty
// a shall be true sometime in the strict future
property p6;
s_nexttime s_eventually a;
endproperty
// if there are at least two more clock ticks, a shall be true at the second
// future clock tick
property p7;
nexttime[2] a;
endproperty
// there shall be at least two more clock ticks, and a shall be true at the
// second future clock tick
property p8;
s_nexttime[2] a;

#### 16.12.11 Always property

A property is an always if it has one of the following forms:
—
Weak always
always property_expr
A property always property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, property_expr holds at every
current or future clock tick.
—
Ranged form of weak always
always [ cycle_delay_const_range_expression ] property_expr
A property always [cycle_delay_const_range_expression] property_expr evaluates to true if, and
only if, property_expr holds at every current or future clock tick that is within the range of clock
ticks specified by cycle_delay_const_range_expression. It is not required that all clock ticks within
this range exist. The range for a weak always may be unbounded.
—
Ranged form of strong always
s_always [ constant_range ] property_expr
A property s_always [constant_range] property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, all current
or future clock ticks specified by constant_range exist and property_expr holds at each of these
clock ticks. The range for a strong always shall be bounded.
The range of clock ticks given by constant_range shall adhere to the following restrictions. The minimum
number of clock ticks is defined by a non-negative integer constant expression; and the maximum number of
clock ticks either is defined by a non-negative integer constant expression or is $, indicating a finite, but
unbounded, maximum. If both the minimum and maximum numbers of clock ticks are defined by non-
negative integer constant expressions (see 11.2.1), then the minimum number shall be less than or equal to
the maximum number.
The preceding explanations refer to the case where the always property is evaluated in a time step that is a
tick of the clock of the always property. When the always property is evaluated in a time step that is not a
tick of the clock of the always property, an alignment to the tick of the clock of the always property should
be applied before the preceding description. Thus, it is more precise to say that s_always[n:m]
property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, there exist m+1 ticks of the clock of the always property,
including the current time step, and property_expr evaluates to true beginning in all of the n+1 to m+1 clock
ticks, where counting starts at the current time step.
There is also the implicit always that is associated with concurrent assertions (see 16.5). A verification
statement that is not placed inside an initial procedure specifies that an evaluation attempt of its top-level
property shall begin at each occurrence of its leading clocking event. In the following two examples, there is
a one-to-one correspondence between the evaluation attempts of p specified by the implicit always from the
verification statement implicit_always and the evaluation attempts of p specified by the explicit always
operator in explicit_always:
Implicit form:
implicit_always: assert property(p);
Explicit form:
initial explicit_always: assert property(always p);
This is not shown as a practical example, but only for illustration of the meaning of always.

Examples:
initial a1: assume property( @(posedge clk) reset[*5] #=# always !reset);
property p1;
a ##1 b |=> always c;
endproperty
property p2;
always [2:5] a;
endproperty
property p3;
s_always [2:5] a;
endproperty
property p4;
always [2:$] a;
endproperty
property p5;
s_always [2:$] a; // Illegal
endproperty
The assertion a1 says that reset shall be true for the first 5 clock ticks and then remain 0 for the rest of the
computation. The assumption is being evaluated once starting at the first clock tick. The property p1
evaluates to true provided that if a is true at the first clock tick and b is true at the second clock tick, then c
shall be true at every clock tick that follows the second. The properties p2 and p3 evaluate to true provided
that a is true at each of the second through fifth clock ticks after the starting clock tick of the evaluation
attempt. Property p3 evaluates to true provided that these clock ticks exist, while property p2 does not
require that. The property p4 evaluates to true if, and only if, a is true at every clock tick that is at least two
clock ticks after the starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt. These clock ticks are not required to exist.
The property p5 is illegal since specifying an unbounded range is not permitted with the strong form of an
always property.
#### 16.12.12 Until property

A property is an until if it has one of the following forms:
—
Weak non-overlapping form
property_expr1 until property_expr2
—
Strong non-overlapping form
property_expr1 s_until property_expr2
—
Weak overlapping form
property_expr1 until_with property_expr2
—
Strong overlapping form
property_expr1 s_until_with property_expr2
An until property of the non-overlapping form evaluates to true if property_expr1 evaluates to true at every
clock tick beginning with the starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt and continuing until at least one
tick before a clock tick where property_expr2 evaluates to true. An until property of one of the overlapping
forms evaluates to true if property_expr1 evaluates to true at every clock tick beginning with the starting

clock tick of the evaluation attempt and continuing until and including a clock tick at which property_expr2
evaluates to true. An until property of one of the strong forms requires a current or future clock tick exist at
which property_expr2 evaluates to true, while an until property of one of the weak forms does not make this
requirement. An until property of one of the weak forms evaluates to true if property_expr1 evaluates to true
at each clock tick, even if property_expr2 never holds.
Examples:
property p1;
a until b;
endproperty
property p2;
a s_until b;
endproperty
property p3;
a until_with b;
endproperty
property p4;
a s_until_with b;
endproperty
Property p1 evaluates to true if, and only if, a is true at every clock tick beginning with the starting clock
tick of the evaluation attempt and continuing until, but not necessarily including, a clock tick at which b is
true. If there is no current or future clock tick at which b is true, than a shall be true at every current or future
clock tick. If b is true at the starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt, then a need not be true at that clock
tick. The property p2 evaluates to true provided that there exists a current or future clock tick at which b is
true and that a is true at every clock tick beginning with the starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt and
continuing until, but not necessarily including, the clock tick at which b is true. If b is true at the starting
clock tick of the evaluation attempt, then a need not be true at that clock tick. The property p3 evaluates to
true provided that a is true at every clock tick beginning with the starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt
and continuing until and including a clock tick at which b is true. If there is no current or future clock tick at
which b is true, than a shall be true at every current or future clock tick. The property p4 evaluates to true
provided there exists a current or future clock tick at which b is true and that a is true at every clock tick
beginning with the starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt and continuing until and including the clock
tick at which b is true. The property p4 is equivalent to strong(a[*1:$] ##0 b) (here a and b are
Boolean expressions).
#### 16.12.13 Eventually property

A property is an eventually if it has one of the following forms:
—
Strong eventually
s_eventually property_expr
A property s_eventually property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, there exists a current or
future clock tick at which property_expr evaluates to true.
—
Ranged form of weak eventually
eventually [ constant_range ] property_expr
A property eventually [constant_range] property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, either
there exists a current or future clock tick within the range specified by constant_range at which
property_expr evaluates to true or not all the current or future clock ticks within the range specified

by constant_range exist. The range for a weak eventually shall be bounded.
—
Ranged form of strong eventually
s_eventually [ cycle_delay_const_range_expression ] property_expr
A property s_eventually [cycle_delay_const_range_expression] property_expr evaluates to true
if, and only if, there exists a current or future clock tick within the range specified by
cycle_delay_const_range_expression at which property_expr evaluates to true. The range for a
strong eventually may be unbounded.
In the following examples, a and b are Boolean expressions:
property p1;
s_eventually a;
endproperty
property p2;
s_eventually always a;
endproperty
property p3;
always s_eventually a;
endproperty
property p4;
eventually [2:5] a;
endproperty
property p5;
s_eventually [2:5] a;
endproperty
property p6;
eventually [2:$] a; // Illegal
endproperty
property p7;
s_eventually [2:$] a;
endproperty
The property p1 evaluates to true if, and only if, there exists a current or future clock tick at which a is true.
It is equivalent to strong(##[*0:$] a). The property p2 evaluates to true if, and only if, there exists a
current or future clock tick such that a is true both at that clock tick and also at every subsequent clock tick.
On a computation with infinitely many clock ticks, the property p3 evaluates to true if, and only if, a is true
at infinitely many of those clock ticks. On a computation with finitely many clock ticks, the property p3
evaluates to true provided that if there is at least one clock tick, then a holds at the last clock tick. The
property p4 evaluates to true provided that if the second through fifth clock ticks from the starting clock tick
of the evaluation attempt all exist, then a is true at one of these clock ticks. p4 is equivalent to
weak(##[2:5] a). The property p5 evaluates to true if, and only if, there exists a clock tick at which a is
true and that it is between the second and fifth clock ticks, inclusive, from the starting clock tick of the
evaluation attempt. p5 is equivalent to strong(##[2:5] a). The property p7 evaluates to true if, and only
if, there exists a clock tick at which a is true and that it is no earlier than the second clock tick after the
starting clock tick of the evaluation attempt.
The preceding explanations refer to the case where the eventually property is evaluated in a time step that is
a tick of the clock of the eventually property. When the eventually property is evaluated in a time step that is

not a tick of the clock of the eventually property, an alignment to the tick of the clock of the eventually
property should be applied before the preceding description. Thus, it is more precise to say that
s_eventually[n:m] property_expr evaluates to true if, and only if, there exist at least n+1 ticks of the
clock of the eventually property, including the current time step, and property_expr evaluates to true
beginning in one of the n+1 to m+1 clock ticks, where counting starts at the current time step.
#### 16.12.14 Abort properties

A property is an abort if it has one of the following forms:
accept_on ( expression_or_dist ) property_expr
reject_on ( expression_or_dist ) property_expr
sync_accept_on ( expression_or_dist ) property_expr
sync_reject_on ( expression_or_dist ) property_expr
where the expression_or_dist is called the abort condition. The properties accept_on and reject_on are
called asynchronous abort properties, and the properties sync_accept_on and sync_reject_on are
called synchronous abort properties.
For
an
evaluation
of
accept_on (expression_or_dist) property_expr
and
of
sync_accept_on (expression_or_dist) property_expr, there is an evaluation of the underlying
property_expr. If during the evaluation, the abort condition becomes true, then the overall evaluation of the
property results in true. Otherwise, the overall evaluation of the property is equal to the evaluation of the
property_expr.
For
an
evaluation
of
reject_on (expression_or_dist) property_expr
and
of
sync_reject_on (expression_or_dist) property_expr, there is an evaluation of the underlying
property_expr. If during the evaluation, the abort condition becomes true, then the overall evaluation of the
property results in false. Otherwise, the overall evaluation of the property is equal to the evaluation of the
property_expr.
The operators accept_on and reject_on are evaluated at the granularity of the simulation time step like
disable iff, but their abort condition is evaluated using sampled value as a regular Boolean expression in
assertions. The operators accept_on and reject_on represent asynchronous resets.
The operators sync_accept_on and sync_reject_on are evaluated at the simulation time step when the
clocking event happens, unlike disable iff, accept_on, and reject_on. Their abort condition is
evaluated using sampled value as for accept_on and reject_on. The operators sync_accept_on and
sync_reject_on represent synchronous resets.
The semantics of accept_on is similar to disable iff, except for the following differences:
—
accept_on operates at the property level rather than the concurrent assertion level.
—
accept_on uses sampled values.
—
While a disable condition of a disable iff in a property_spec may cause an evaluation of the
property_spec to be disabled, an abort condition of accept_on in a property_expr may cause the
evaluation of the property_expr to be true.
The

of
reject_on(expression_or_dist)
property_expr
is
the

as
not(accept_on(expression_or_dist) not(property_expr)).
The semantics of sync_accept_on is similar to accept_on, except that it evaluates only at the time steps
when the clocking event happens.

The
semantics
of
sync_reject_on(expression_or_dist) property_expr
is
the
same
as
not(sync_accept_on(expression_or_dist) not(property_expr)).
Any nesting of abort operators accept_on, reject_on, sync_accept_on, and sync_reject_on is
allowed.
For example, whenever go is high, followed by two occurrences of get being high, then stop cannot be
high until after put is asserted twice (not necessarily consecutive).
assert property (@(clk) go ##1 get[*2] |-> reject_on(stop) put[->2]);
In this example the stop is an asynchronous abort, its value is checked even between ticks of clk. The
following is the synchronous version of the same example:
assert property (@(clk) go ##1 get[*2] |-> sync_reject_on(stop) put[->2]);
Here stop is checked only at the clk ticks. The latter assertion can also be written as follows:
assert property (@(clk) go ##1 get[*2] |-> !stop throughout put[->2]);
When the abort condition occurs at the same time step where the evaluation of the property_expr ends, the
abort condition takes precedence. For example:
 property p; (accept_on(a) p1) and (reject_on(b) p2); endproperty
If a becomes true during the evaluation of p1, the first term is ignored in deciding the truth of p. On the other
hand, if b becomes true during the evaluation of p2 then p evaluates to false.
 property p; (accept_on(a) p1) or (reject_on(b) p2); endproperty
If a becomes true during the evaluation of p1 then p evaluates to true. On the other hand, if b becomes true
during the evaluation of p2, then the second term is ignored in deciding the truth of p.
 property p; not (accept_on(a) p1); endproperty
not inverts the effect of the abort operator. Therefore, if a becomes true while evaluating p1, property p
evaluates to false.
Nested accept_on, reject_on, sync_accept_on, and sync_reject_on operators are evaluated in the
lexical order (left to right). Therefore, if two nested operator conditions become true in the same time step
during the evaluation of the argument property, then the outermost operator takes precedence. For example:
property p; accept_on(a) reject_on(b) p1; endproperty
If a becomes true in the same time step as b and during the evaluation of p1, then p succeeds in that time
step. If b becomes true before a and during the evaluation of p1, then p fails.
The abort conditions may contain sampled value functions (see 16.9.3). When sampled value functions other
than $sampled are used in the abort condition, the clock argument shall be explicitly specified. Abort
conditions shall not contain any reference to local variables and the sequence methods triggered and
matched.

#### 16.12.15 Weak and strong operators

The property operators s_nexttime, s_always, s_eventually, s_until, s_until_with, and
sequence operator strong are strong: they require that some terminating condition happen in the future, and
this includes the requirement that the property clock ticks enough time to enable the condition to happen.
The property operators nexttime, always, until, eventually, until_with, and sequence operator
weak are weak: they do not impose any requirement on the terminating condition, and do not require the
clock to tick.
The concept of weak and strong operators is closely related to an important notion of safety properties.
Safety properties have the characteristic that all their failures happen at a finite time. For example, the
property always a is a safety property since it is violated only if after finitely many clock ticks there is a
clock tick at which a is false, even if there are infinitely many clock ticks in the computation. To the
contrary, a failure of the property s_eventually a on a computation with infinitely many clock ticks
cannot be identified at a finite time; if it is violated, the value of a shall be false at each of the infinitely
many clock ticks.
#### 16.12.16 Case

The case property statement is a multiway decision that tests whether a Boolean expression matches one of
a number of other Boolean expressions and branches accordingly (see Syntax 16-17).
```ebnf
property_expr ::=
```

// from A.2.10
...
| case ( expression_or_dist ) property_case_item { property_case_item } endcase
...
```ebnf
property_case_item ::=
```

expression_or_dist { , expression_or_dist } : property_expr ;
| default [ : ] property_expr ;
Syntax 16-17—Property statement case syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The default statement shall be optional. Use of multiple default statements in one property case statement
shall be illegal.
A simple example of the use of the case property statement is the decoding of variable delay to produce a
delay between the check of two signals as follows:
property p_delay(logic [1:0] delay);
case (delay)
2'd0
: a && b;
2'd1
: a ##2 b;
2'd2
: a ##4 b;
2'd3
: a ##8 b;
default: 0;
// cause a failure if delay has x or z values
endcase
endproperty
During the linear search, if one of the case item expressions matches the case expression given in
parentheses, then the property statement associated with that case item shall be evaluated, and the linear
search shall terminate. If there is a default case item, it is ignored during this linear search. If all comparisons
fail and the default item is given, then the default item property statement shall be executed. If the default

property statement is not given and all of the comparisons fail, then none of the case item property
statements shall be evaluated and the evaluation of the case property statement from that start point succeeds
and returns true (vacuously).
The rules for comparing the case expression to the case item expressions are described in 12.5.
#### 16.12.17 Recursive properties

SystemVerilog allows recursive properties. A named property is recursive if its declaration involves an
instantiation of itself. Recursion provides a flexible framework for coding properties to serve as ongoing
assumptions, obligations, or coverage monitors.
For example:
property prop_always(p);
p and (1'b1 |=> prop_always(p));
endproperty
is a recursive property that says that the formal argument property p is required to hold at every cycle. This
example is useful if the ongoing requirement that property p hold applies after a complicated triggering
condition encoded in sequence s:
property p1(s,p);
s |=> prop_always(p);
endproperty
As another example, the recursive property
property prop_weak_until(p,q);
q or (p and (1'b1 |=> prop_weak_until(p,q)));
endproperty
says that formal argument property p is required to hold at every cycle up to, but not including, the first
cycle at which formal argument property q holds. Formal argument property q is not required ever to hold,
however. This example is useful if p is required to hold at every cycle after a complicated triggering
condition encoded in sequence s, but the requirement on p is lifted by q:
property p2(s,p,q);
s |=> prop_weak_until(p,q);
endproperty
More generally, several properties can be mutually recursive. For example:
property check_phase1;
s1 |-> (phase1_prop and (1'b1 |=> check_phase2));
endproperty
property check_phase2;
s2 |-> (phase2_prop and (1'b1 |=> check_phase1));
endproperty
There are four restrictions on recursive property declarations, as follows:
—
Restriction 1: The negation operator not and strong operators s_nexttime, s_eventually,
s_always, s_until, and s_until_with cannot be applied to any property expression that
instantiates a recursive property. In particular, the negation of a recursive property cannot be
asserted or used in defining another property.

IEEE Std 1800-2023
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
460
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
The following are examples of illegal property declarations that violate Restriction 1:
property illegal_recursion_1(p);
not prop_always(not p);
endproperty
property illegal_recursion_2(p);
p and (1'b1 |=> not illegal_recursion_2(p));
endproperty
Furthermore, not cannot be applied to any property expression that instantiates a property that
depends on a recursive property. The precise definition of dependency is given in F.7.
—
Restriction 2: The operator disable iff cannot be used in the declaration of a recursive property.
This restriction is consistent with the restriction that disable iff cannot be nested.
The following is an example of an illegal property declaration that violates Restriction 2:
property illegal_recursion_3(p);
disable iff (b)
p and (1'b1 |=> illegal_recursion_3(p));
endproperty
The intent of illegal_recursion_3 can be written legally as follows:
property legal_3(p);
disable iff (b) prop_always(p);
endproperty
because legal_3 is not a recursive property.
—
Restriction 3: If p is a recursive property, then, in the declaration of p, every instance of p shall
occur after a positive advance in time. In the case of mutually recursive properties, all recursive
instances shall occur after positive advances in time.
The following is an example of an illegal property declaration that violates Restriction 3:
property illegal_recursion_4(p);
p and (1'b1 |-> illegal_recursion_4(p));
endproperty
If this form were legal, the recursion would be stuck in time, checking p over and over again at the
same cycle.
—
Restriction 4: For every recursive instance of property q in the declaration of property p, each actual
argument expression e of the instance satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
•
e is itself a formal argument of p.
•
No formal argument of p appears in e.
•
e is bound to a local variable formal argument of q.
For example:
property fibonacci1 (local input int a, b, n, int fib_sig);
(n > 0)
|->
(
(fib_sig == a)
and

(1'b1 |=> fibonacci1(b, a + b, n - 1, fib_sig))
);
endproperty
is a legal declaration, but
property fibonacci2 (int a, b, n, fib_sig);
(n > 0)
|->
(
(fib_sig == a)
and
(1'b1 |=> fibonacci2(b, a + b, n - 1, fib_sig))
);
endproperty
is not legal because, in the recursive instance fibonacci2(b, a+b, n-1, fib_sig), the actual
argument expressions a+b, n-1 are not themselves formal arguments of fibonacci2, are not
bound to local variable formal arguments, and yet formal arguments of fibonacci2 appear in these
expressions.
The operators accept_on, reject_on, sync_accept_on, and sync_reject_on may be used inside a
recursive property. For example, the following uses of accept_on and reject_on in a property are legal:
property p3(p, bit b, abort);
(p and (1'b1 |=> p4(p, b, abort)));
endproperty
property p4(p, bit b, abort);
accept_on(b) reject_on(abort) p3(p, b, abort);
endproperty
Recursive properties can represent complicated requirements, such as those associated with varying
numbers of data beats, out-of-order completions, retries, etc. Following is an example of using a recursive
property to check complicated conditions of this kind.
Suppose that write data needs to be checked according to the following conditions:
—
Acknowledgment of a write request is indicated by the signal write_request together with
write_request_ack. When a write request is acknowledged, it gets a 4-bit tag, indicated by
signal write_reqest_ack_tag. The tag is used to distinguish data beats for multiple write
transactions in flight at the same time.
—
It is understood that distinct write transactions in flight at the same time have to be given distinct
tags. For simplicity, this condition is not a part of what is checked in this example.
—
Each write transaction can have between 1 data beat and 16 data beats, and each data beat is 8 bits.
There is a model of the expected write data that is available at acknowledgment of a write request.
The model is a 128-bit vector. The most significant group of 8 bits represents the expected data for
the first beat, the next group of 8 bits represents the expected data for the second beat (if there is a
second beat), and so forth.
—
Data transfer for a write transaction occurs after acknowledgment of the write request and, barring
retry, ends with the last data beat. The data beats for a single write transaction occur in order.
—
A data beat is indicated by the data_valid signal together with the signal data_valid_tag to
determine the relevant write transaction. The signal data are valid with data_valid and carry the
data for that beat. The data for each beat have to be correct according to the model of the expected
write data.

—
The last data beat is indicated by signal last_data_valid together with data_valid and
data_valid_tag. For simplicity, this example does not represent the number of data beats and
does not check that last_data_valid is signaled at the correct beat.
—
At any time after acknowledgment of the write request, but not later than the cycle after the last data
beat, a write transaction can be forced to retry. Retry is indicated by the signal retry together with
signal retry_tag to identify the relevant write transaction. If a write transaction is forced to retry,
then its current data transfer is aborted, and the entire data transfer has to be repeated. The
transaction does not re-request, and its tag does not change.
—
There is no limit on the number of times a write transaction can be forced to retry.
—
A write transaction completes the cycle after the last data beat provided it is not forced to retry in
that cycle.
The following is code to check these conditions:
property check_write;
logic [0:127] expected_data;
// local variable to sample model data
logic [3:0] tag;
// local variable to sample tag
disable iff (reset)
(
write_request && write_request_ack,
expected_data = model_data,
tag = write_request_ack_tag
)
|=>
check_write_data_beat(expected_data, tag, 4'h0);
endproperty

local input logic [0:127] expected_data,

);

(data == expected_data[i*8+:8])
)
and

(
1'b1 |=> check_write_data_beat(expected_data, tag, 4'h0)
)

endproperty
#### 16.12.18 Typed formal arguments in property declarations

The rules in 16.8.1 for typed formal arguments and their corresponding actual arguments apply to named
properties, except as described next.
If a formal argument of a named property is typed, then the type shall be property, sequence, event, or
one of the types allowed in 16.6. If the formal argument is of type property, then the corresponding actual
argument shall be a property_expr, and each reference to the formal argument shall be in a place where a
property_expr may be written.
For example, a Boolean expression or a sequence_expr may be passed as actual argument to a formal
argument of type property because each is a property_expr. A formal argument of type property may
not be referenced as the antecedent of |-> or |=> (see 16.12.7), regardless of the corresponding actual
argument, because a property_expr may not be written in that position.
#### 16.12.19 Local variable formal arguments in property declarations

The rules in 16.8.2 for local variable formal arguments and their corresponding actual arguments apply to
named properties, except as described next.
A local variable formal argument of a named property shall have direction input, either specified explicitly
or inferred. It shall be illegal to declare a local variable formal argument of a named property with direction
inout or output.
#### 16.12.20 Property examples

The following examples illustrate the property forms:
property rule1;
@(posedge clk) a |-> b ##1 c ##1 d;
endproperty
property rule2;
@(clkev) disable iff (e) a |-> not(b ##1 c ##1 d);
endproperty
Property rule2 negates the sequence (b ##1 c ##1 d) in the consequent of the implication. clkev
specifies the clock for the property.
property rule3;
@(posedge clk) a[*2] |-> ((##[1:3] c) or (d |=> e));
endproperty
Property rule3 says that if a holds and a also held last cycle, then either c shall hold at some point one to
three cycles after the current cycle or, if d holds in the current cycle, then e shall hold one cycle later.

property rule4;
@(posedge clk) a[*2] |-> ((##[1:3] c) and (d |=> e));
endproperty
Property rule4 says that if a holds and a also held last cycle, then c shall hold at some point one to three
cycles after the current cycle and, if d holds in the current cycle, then e shall hold one cycle later.
property rule5;
@(posedge clk)
a ##1 (b || c)[->1] |->
if (b)
(##1 d |-> e)
else // c
f ;
endproperty
Property rule5 has a followed by the next occurrence of either b or c as its antecedent. The consequent
uses if–else to split cases on which of b or c is matched first.
property rule6(x,y);
##1 x |-> y;
endproperty
property rule5a;
@(posedge clk)
a ##1 (b || c)[->1] |->
if (b)
rule6(d,e)
else // c
f ;
endproperty
Property rule5a is equivalent to rule5, but it uses an instance of rule6 as a property expression.
A property may optionally specify a clocking event for the clock. The clock derivation and resolution rules
are described in 16.16.
A named property can be instantiated by referencing its name. A hierarchical name can be used, consistent
with the SystemVerilog naming conventions. Like sequence declarations, variables used within a property
that are not formal arguments to the property are resolved hierarchically from the scope in which the
property is declared.
Properties that use more than one clock are described in 16.13.
#### 16.12.21 Finite-length versus infinite-length behavior

The formal semantics in F.5 defines whether a given property holds on a given behavior. How the outcome
of this evaluation relates to the design depends on the behavior that was analyzed. In dynamic verification,
only behaviors that are finite in length are considered. In such a case, SystemVerilog defines the following
four levels of satisfaction of a property:
—
Holds strongly
•
No bad states have been seen.
•
All future obligations have been met.
•
The property will hold on any extension of the path.
—
Holds (but does not hold strongly)

—
Fails
•
A bad state has been seen.
•
Future obligations may or may not have been met.

The property will not hold on any extension of the path.
#### 16.12.22 Nondegeneracy

It is possible to define sequences that can never be matched. For example:
(1'b1) intersect(1'b1 ##1 1'b1)
It is also possible to define sequences that admit only empty matches. For example:
1'b1[*0]
A zero consecutive repetition means that there is no sample taken at any clock tick. Therefore, such a
sequence can only match on an empty trace (as formally defined in F.4.3). A sequence may admit both
empty and nonempty matches, for example, a[*0:2]. This sequence admits an empty match and up to two
nonempty matches: a and a[*2].
A sequence that admits no match or that admits only empty matches is called degenerate. A sequence that
admits at least one nonempty match is called nondegenerate. A more precise definition of nondegeneracy is
given in F.5.2 and F.5.5.
The following restrictions apply:
a)
Any sequence that is used as a property shall be nondegenerate and shall not admit any empty
match.
b)
Any sequence that is used as the antecedent of an overlapping implication (|->) shall be
nondegenerate.
c)
Any sequence that is used as the antecedent of a nonoverlapping implication (|=>) shall admit at
least one match. Such a sequence can admit only empty matches.
The reason for these restrictions is because the use of degenerate sequences in forbidden ways results in
counterintuitive property semantics, especially when the property is combined with a disable iff clause.
### 16.13 Multiclock support

Multiclock sequences and properties can be specified as described in the following subclauses.
#### 16.13.1 Multiclocked sequences

Multiclocked sequences are built by concatenating singly clocked subsequences using the single-delay
concatenation operator ##1 or the zero-delay concatenation operator ##0. The single delay indicated by ##1
is understood to be from the end point of the first sequence, which occurs at a tick of the first clock, to the
Authorized licensed use limited to: Richard DJE. Downloaded on February 27,2026 at 08:44:11 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.

nearest strictly subsequent tick of the second clock, where the second sequence begins. The zero delay
indicated by ##0 is understood to be from the end point of the first sequence, which occurs at a tick of the
first clock, to the nearest possibly overlapping tick of the second clock, where the second sequence begins.
Example 1:
@(posedge clk0) sig0 ##1 @(posedge clk1) sig1
A match of this sequence starts with a match of sig0 at posedge clk0. Then ##1 moves the time to the
nearest strictly subsequent posedge clk1, and the match of the sequence ends at that point with a match of
sig1. If clk0 and clk1 are not identical, then the clocking event for the sequence changes after ##1. If
clk0 and clk1 are identical, then the clocking event does not change after ##1, and the preceding sequence
is equivalent to the singly clocked sequence
@(posedge clk0) sig0 ##1 sig1
Example 2:
@(posedge clk0) sig0 ##0 @(posedge clk1) sig1
A match of this sequence starts with a match of sig0 at posedge clk0. Then ##0 moves the time to the
nearest possibly overlapping posedge clk1, and the match of the sequence ends at that point with a match
of sig1: if posedge clk0 and posedge clk1 happen simultaneously then the time does not move at ##0,
otherwise, it behaves as ##1. If clk0 and clk1 are not identical, then the clocking event for the sequence
changes after ##0. If clk0 and clk1 are identical, then the clocking event does not change after ##0, and the
preceding sequence is equivalent to the following singly clocked sequence:
@(posedge clk0) sig0 ##0 sig1
which is equivalent to the following:
@(posedge clk0) sig0 && sig1
When concatenating differently clocked sequences, the maximal singly clocked subsequences are required
to admit only nonempty matches. The term maximal singly clocked subsequence refers to the largest singly
clocked sequence appearing in a multiclock sequence resulting from the application of the rewriting
algorithm in F.4.1. Such a sequence cannot be enlarged by absorbing any surrounding operators and their
arguments without changing the singly clocked sequence into a multiclock sequence or to a property.
Thus, if s1, s2 are sequence expressions with no clocking events, then the multiclocked sequence
@(posedge clk1) s1 ##1 @(posedge clk2) s2
is legal only if neither s1 nor s2 can match the empty word. The clocking event @(posedge clk1) applies
throughout the match of s1, while the clocking event @(posedge clk2) applies throughout the match of
s2. Because the match of s1 is nonempty, there is an end point of this match at posedge clk1. The ##1
synchronizes between this end point and the first occurrence of posedge clk2 strictly after it. That
occurrence of posedge clk2 is the start point of the match of s2.
A multiclocked sequence has well-defined starting and ending clocking events and well-defined clock
changes because of the restriction that maximal singly clocked subsequences not match the empty word. If
clk1 and clk2 are not identical, then the sequence
@(posedge clk0) sig0 ##1 @(posedge clk1) sig1[*0:1]

is illegal because of the possibility of an empty match of sig1[*0:1], which would make ambiguous
whether the ending clocking event is @(posedge clk0) or @(posedge clk1).
Differently clocked or multiclocked sequence operands cannot be combined with any sequence operators
other than ##1 and ##0. For example, if clk1 and clk2 are not identical, then the following are illegal:
@(posedge clk1) s1 ##2 @(posedge clk2) s2
@(posedge clk1) s1 intersect @(posedge clk2) s2
#### 16.13.2 Multiclocked properties

A clock may be explicitly specified with any property. The property is multiclocked if some of its
subproperties have a clock different from the property clock, or some of its subproperties are multiclocked
sequences.
As in the case of singly clocked properties, the result of evaluating a multiclocked property is either true or
false. Multiclocked sequences are themselves multiclocked properties. For example:
@(posedge clk0) sig0 ##1 @(posedge clk1) sig1
is a multiclocked property. If a multiclocked sequence is evaluated as a property starting at some point, the
evaluation returns true if, and only if, there is a match of the multiclocked sequence beginning at that point.
The following example shows how to form a multiclocked property using Boolean property operators:
(@(posedge clk0) sig0) and (@(posedge clk1) sig1)
This is a multiclocked property, but it is not a multiclocked sequence. This property evaluates to true at a
point if, and only if, the two sequences
@(posedge clk0) sig0
and
@(posedge clk1) sig1
both have matches beginning at the point.
The meaning of multiclocked nonoverlapping implication is similar to that of singly clocked nonoverlapping
implication. For example, if s0 and s1 are sequences with no clocking event, then in
@(posedge clk0) s0 |=> @(posedge clk1) s1
|=> synchronizes between posedge clk0 and posedge clk1. Starting at the point at which the implication
is being evaluated, for each match of s0 clocked by clk0, time is advanced from the end point of the match
to the nearest strictly future occurrence of posedge clk1, and from that point there shall exist a match of s1
clocked by clk1.
The following example shows a combination of differently clocked properties using both implication and
Boolean property operators:
@(posedge clk0) s0 |=> (@(posedge clk1) s1) and (@(posedge clk2) s2)

The multiclocked overlapping implication |-> has the following meaning: at the end of the antecedent the
nearest tick of the consequent clock is awaited. If the consequent clock happens at the end of the antecedent,
the consequent is started checking immediately. Otherwise, the meaning of the multiclocked overlapping
implication is the same as the meaning of the multiclock nonoverlapping implication.
For example, if s0 and s1 are sequences with no clocking events, then
@(posedge clk0) s0 |-> @(posedge clk1) s1
means the following: at each match of s0 the nearest posedge clk1 is awaited. If it happens immediately
then s1 is checked without delay, otherwise its check starts at the next posedge clk1 as in case with |=>.
In both cases the evaluation of s1 is controlled by posedge clk1.
The semantics of multiclocked if/if-else operators is similar to the semantics of the overlapping
implication. For example, if s1 and s2 are sequences with no clocking events, then
@(posedge clk0) if (b) @(posedge clk1) s1 else @(posedge clk2) s2
has the following meaning: the condition b is checked at posedge clk0. If b is true then s1 is checked at
the nearest, possibly overlapping posedge clk1, else s2 is checked at the nearest non-strictly subsequent
posedge clk2.
#### 16.13.3 Clock flow

Throughout this subclause, c and d denote clocking event expressions and v, w, x, y, and z denote sequences
with no clocking events.
Clock flow allows the scope of a clocking event to extend in a natural way through various parts of
multiclocked sequences and properties and reduces the number of places at which the same clocking event
needs to be specified.
Intuitively, clock flow provides that in a multiclocked sequence or property, the scope of a clocking event
flows left to right across linear operators (e.g., repetition, concatenation, negation, implication, followed-by,
and the nexttime, always, eventually operators) and distributes to the operands of branching operators
(e.g., conjunction, disjunction, intersection, if–else, and the until operators) until it is replaced by a new
clocking event.
For example:
@(c) x |=> @(c) y ##1 @(d) z
can be written more simply as
@(c) x |=> y ##1 @(d) z
because clock c is understood to flow across |=>.
Clock flow also makes the adjointness relationships between concatenation and implication clean for
multiclocked properties:
@(c) x ##1 y |=> @(d) z
is equivalent to
@(c) x |=> y |=> @(d) z

and
@(c) x ##0 y |=> @(d) z
is equivalent to
@(c) x |-> y |=> @(d) z
The scope of a clocking event flows into parenthesized subexpressions and, if the subexpression is a
sequence, also flows left to right across the parenthesized subexpression. However, the scope of a clocking
event does not flow out of enclosing parentheses.
For example, in the following:
@(c) w ##1 (x ##1 @(d) y) |=> z
w, x, and z are clocked at c, and y is clocked at d. Clock c flows across ##1, across the parenthesized
subsequence (x ##1 @(d) y), and across |=>. Clock c also flows into the parenthesized subsequence, but
it does not flow through @(d). Clock d does not flow out of its enclosing parentheses.
As another example, in the following:
@(c) v |=> (w ##1 @(d) x) and (y ##1 z)
v, w, y, and z are clocked at c, and x is clocked at d. Clock c flows across |=>, distributes to both operands of
the and (which is a property conjunction due to the multiple clocking), and flows into each of the
parenthesized subexpressions. Within (w ##1 @(d) x), c flows across ##1 but does not flow through
@(d). Clock d does not flow out of its enclosing parentheses. Within (y ##1 z), c flows across ##1.
Similarly, the scope of a clocking event flows into an instance of a named property or sequence, regardless
of whether method triggered or method matched is applied to the instance of the sequence. The scope of
a clocking event flows left to right across an instance of a property or sequence. A clocking event in the
declaration of a property or sequence does not flow out of an instance of that property or sequence.
The scope of a clocking event does not flow into the disable condition of disable iff.
Juxtaposing two clocking events nullifies the first of them; therefore, the following two-clocking-event
statement:
@(d) @(c) x
is equivalent to the following:
@(c) x
because the flow of clock d is immediately overridden by clock c.

#### 16.13.5 Detecting and using end point of a sequence in multiclock context

Method triggered can be applied to detect the end point of a multiclocked sequence. Method triggered
can also be applied to detect the end point of a sequence from within a multiclocked sequence. In both cases,
the ending clock of the sequence instance to which triggered is applied shall be the same as the clock in
the context where the application of method triggered appears.
To detect the end point of a sequence when the clock of the source sequence is different from the destination
sequence, method matched on the source sequence is used. The end point of a sequence is reached
whenever there is a match on its expression.
To detect the end point, the matched method may be applied to a named sequence instance, with or without
arguments, an untyped formal argument, or a formal argument of type sequence, where such is allowed, as
follows:
sequence_instance.matched
or
formal_argument_sequence.matched
matched is a method on a sequence that returns true (1'b1) or false (1'b0) . Unlike triggered, matched
uses synchronization between the two clocks, by storing the result of the source sequence match until the
arrival of the first destination clock tick after the match. The result of matched does not depend upon the
starting point of the source sequence.
Like triggered, matched can be used on sequences that have formal arguments. An example is shown as
follows:
sequence e1(a,b,c);
@(posedge clk) $rose(a) ##1 b ##1 c ;
endsequence
sequence e2;
@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 inst ##1 e1(ready,proc1,proc2).matched [->1]
##1 branch_back;
endsequence
In this example, source sequence e1 is evaluated at clock clk, while the destination sequence e2 is
evaluated at clock sysclk. In e2, the end point of the instance e1(ready,proc1,proc2) is tested to
occur sometime after the occurrence of inst. Notice that method matched only tests for the end point of
e1(ready,proc1,proc2) and has no bearing on the starting point of e1(ready,proc1,proc2).
Local variables can be passed into an instance of a named sequence to which matched is applied. The same
restrictions apply as in the case of triggered. Values of local variables sampled in an instance of a named
sequence to which matched is applied will flow out under the same conditions as for triggered. See
16.10.
As with triggered, a sequence instance to which matched is applied can have multiple matches in a
single cycle of the destination sequence clock. The multiple matches are treated semantically the same way
as matching both disjuncts of an or. In other words, the thread evaluating the destination sequence will fork
to account for such distinct local variable valuations.
#### 16.13.6 Sequence methods

Methods triggered and matched are available to identify the end point of a sequence. The operand
sequence shall be a named sequence instance, with or without arguments, an untyped formal argument, or a
formal argument of type sequence, in the contexts where such arguments are legal. These methods are
invoked using the following syntax:
Authorized licensed use limited to: Richard DJE. Downloaded on February 27,2026 at 08:44:11 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.
IEEE Std 1800-2023
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
472
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
sequence_instance.sequence_method
or
formal_argument_sequence.sequence_method
The results of these operations are true (1'b1) or false (1'b0) and do not depend upon the starting point of
the match of their operand sequence. These methods can be invoked on sequences with formal arguments.
The sampled values of these methods are defined as the current values (see 16.5.1).
The value of method triggered evaluates to true (1'b1) if the operand sequence has reached its end point
at that particular point in time and false (1'b0) otherwise. The triggered status of the sequence is set in the
Observed region and persists through the remainder of the time step. In addition to using this method in
assertion statements, it may be used in wait statements (see 9.4.4) or Boolean expressions outside a
sequence context. It shall be considered an error to invoke this method outside a sequence context on
sequences that treat their formal arguments as local variables. A sequence treats its formal argument as a
local variable if the formal argument is used as an lvalue in operator_assignment or inc_or_dec_expression
in sequence_match_item. There shall be no circular dependencies between sequences induced by the use of
triggered.
The method matched is used to detect the end point of one sequence (the source sequence) referenced in a
multiclocked sequence (the destination sequence). It can only be used in sequence expressions. Unlike
triggered, matched provides synchronization between two clocks by storing the result of the source
sequence until the arrival of the first clock tick of the destination sequence after the match. The matched
status of the sequence is set in the Observed region and persists until the Observed region following the
arrival of the first clock tick of the destination sequence after the match.
It shall be considered an error to use the sequence method matched in sampled value functions (see 16.9.3).
An example of using the previous methods on a sequence is shown as follows:
sequence e1;
@(posedge sysclk) $rose(a) ##1 b ##1 c;
endsequence
sequence e2;
@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 inst ##1 e1.triggered ##1 branch_back;
endsequence
sequence e3;
@(posedge clk) reset1 ##1 e1.matched ##1 branch_back1;
endsequence
sequence e2_with_arg(sequence subseq);
@(posedge sysclk) reset ##1 inst ##1 subseq.triggered ##1 branch_back;
endsequence
sequence e4;
e2_with_arg(@(posedge sysclk) $rose(a) ##1 b ##1 c);
endsequence
program check;
initial begin
wait (e1.triggered || e2.triggered);
if (e1.triggered)
$display("e1 passed");
if (e2.triggered)

$display("e2 passed");
L2: ...
end
endprogram
In the preceding example, sequence e2 tests for the end point of sequence e1 using method triggered
because both sequences use the same clock. The sequence e3 tests for the end point of sequence e1 using
method matched because e1 and e3 use different clocks. The sequence e4 is semantically equivalent to e2
and shows an application of the sequence method triggered on a formal argument of type sequence. The
initial procedure in the program waits for the end point of either e1 or e2. When either e1 or e2
evaluates to true, the wait statement unblocks the initial process. The process then displays the sequence that
caused it to unblock, and then continues to execute at the statement labeled L2.
The sequence on which a method is applied shall either be clocked or infer the clock from the context where
it is used. The same rules are used to infer the clocking event as specified in 16.9.3 for sampled value
functions.
If $inferred_clock is specified as the default value for a formal argument of a sequence (see 16.14.7),
and an actual argument is not provided to the sequence instance to which a method is applied, the same rules
as specified in 16.9.3 for sampled value functions are used to determine the inferred clocking event that is
bound to that formal argument.
If a sequence with a method is passed as an actual argument to a checker instantiation, it is substituted in
place of the corresponding formal argument. Such a sequence shall be clocked as if it were instantiated
inside the checker.
If a sequence with a method is connected to a port of a module instantiation, it shall be clocked as if it were
instantiated at the place of module instantiation. The same rule shall apply if a sequence with a method is
connected to a port of an interface or program instantiation or passed as an actual argument to a function or
task call.
The preceding rules for inferring the clocking event also apply to a sequence instantiated in an event
expression.
The following examples illustrate how a clock is inferred by a sequence when a method is applied to it.

#### 16.13.7 Local variable initialization assignments

For singly clocked sequences and properties, a local variable initialization assignment for an evaluation
attempt of an instance of a named sequence or property is performed when the evaluation attempt begins.
Such an evaluation attempt always begins in a time step in which there is a tick of the single governing
clock.
For multiclock sequences and properties, a local variable initialization assignment for an evaluation attempt
of an instance of a named sequence or property with a single semantic leading clock (see 16.16.1) shall be
performed at the earliest tick of the semantic leading clock that is at or after the beginning of the evaluation
attempt. If there are two or more distinct semantic leading clocks for an instance of a named property, then a
separate copy of the local variable shall be created for each semantic leading clock. For each copy of the
local variable, the initialization assignment shall be performed at the earliest tick of the corresponding
semantic leading clock that is at or after the beginning of the evaluation attempt, and that copy of the local
variable shall be used in the evaluation of the subproperty associated with the corresponding semantic
leading clock.
For example, let
property p;
logic v = e;
(@(posedge clk1) (a == v)[*1:$] |-> b)
and
(@(posedge clk2) c[*1:$] |-> d == v)
;
endproperty
a1: assert property (@(posedge clk) f |=> p);
where f is of type logic. The instance of p in assertion a1 has two semantic leading clocks, posedge clk1
and posedge clk2. Separate copies of the local variable v are created for the two subproperties governed
by these clocks. Let t0 be a time step in which posedge clk occurs and in which the sampled value of f is
true. According to the structure of a1, an evaluation attempt of the instance of p starts strictly after t0. Let
t1 be the earliest time step after t0 in which posedge clk1 occurs, and let t2 be the earliest time step after
t0 in which posedge clk2 occurs. Then a declaration assignment v = e is performed in t1, and the value
is assigned to the copy of v associated with posedge clk1. This value is used in the evaluation of the
subproperty (a == v)[*1:$] |-> b. Similarly, a declaration assignment v = e is performed in t2, and
the value is assigned to the copy of v associated with posedge clk2. This value is used in the evaluation of
the subproperty c[*1:$] |-> d == v.
An equivalent declaration of p that does not use local variable declaration assignments is as follows:
property p;
logic v;
(@(posedge clk1) (1, v = e) ##0 (a == v)[*1:$] |-> b)
and
(@(posedge clk2) (1, v = e) ##0 c[*1:$] |-> d == v)
;
endproperty
### 16.14 Concurrent assertions

A property on its own is never evaluated for checking an expression. It shall be used within an assertion
statement (see 16.2) for this to occur.

Syntax 16-18—Concurrent assertion construct syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The execution of assertion statements can be controlled using assertion control system tasks (see 20.11).
A concurrent assertion statement can be referenced by its optional name. A hierarchical name can be used
consistent with the SystemVerilog naming conventions. When a name is not provided, a tool shall assign a
name to the statement for the purpose of reporting. Unnamed assertions do not create a scope.
#### 16.14.1 Assert statement

The assert statement is used to enforce a property. When the property for the assert statement is
evaluated to be true, the pass statements of the action_block are executed. When the property for the assert
statement is evaluated to be false, the fail statements of the action_block are executed. When the property for
the assert statement is evaluated to be disabled, no action_block statement is executed. The execution of
pass and fail statements can be controlled by using assertion action control tasks. The assertion action
control tasks are described in 20.11.

For example:
property abc(a, b, c);
disable iff (a==2) @(posedge clk) not (b ##1 c);
endproperty
env_prop: assert property (abc(rst, in1, in2))
$display("env_prop passed."); else $display("env_prop failed.");
When no action is needed, a null statement (i.e., ; ) is specified. If the else clause is omitted, the tool shall
call $error when the assertion fails, unless $assertcontrol is used to suppress the failure (see 20.11).
The action_block shall not include any concurrent assert, assume, or cover statement. The action_block,
however, can contain immediate assertion statements.
The conventions regarding default severity (error) and the use of severity system tasks in concurrent
assertion action blocks shall be the same as those specified for immediate assertions in 16.3.
The pass and fail statements of an assert statement are executed in the Reactive region. The regions of
execution are explained in the scheduling semantics in Clause 4.
#### 16.14.2 Assume statement

The purpose of the assume statement is to allow properties to be considered as assumptions for formal
analysis as well as for dynamic simulation tools. When a property is assumed, the tools constrain the
environment so that the property holds.
For formal analysis, there is no obligation to verify that the assumed properties hold. An assumed property
can be considered as a hypothesis to prove the asserted properties.
For simulation, the environment needs to be constrained so that the properties that are assumed shall hold.
Like an asserted property, an assumed property shall be checked and reported if it fails to hold. When the
property for the assume statement is evaluated to be true, the pass statements of the action_block are
executed. If it evaluates to false, the fail statements of the action_block are executed. For example:
property abc(a, b, c);
disable iff (c) @(posedge clk) a |=> b;
endproperty
env_prop:
assume property (abc(req, gnt, rst)) else $error("Assumption failed.");
When no action is needed, a null statement (i.e., ; ) is specified. If the else clause is omitted, the tool shall
call $error when the assertion fails, unless $assertcontrol is used to suppress the failure (see 20.11).
If the property has a disabled evaluation, neither the pass nor fail statements of the action_block are
executed. The execution of pass and fail statements can be controlled by using assertion action control tasks.
The assertion action control tasks are described in 20.11.
Additionally, for random simulation, biasing on the inputs provides a way to make random choices. An
expression can be associated with biasing as follows:
expression dist { dist_list } // from A.1.10
Distribution sets and the dist operator are explained in 18.5.3.

IEEE Std 1800-2023
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
478
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
The biasing feature is useful when properties are considered as assumptions to drive random simulation.
When a property with biasing is used within an assert or cover assertion statement, the dist operator is
equivalent to the inside operator, and the weight specification is ignored. For example:
a1:assume property ( @(posedge clk) req dist {0:=40, 1:=60} ) ;
property proto ;
@(posedge clk) req |-> req[*1:$] ##0 ack;
endproperty
This is equivalent to the following:
a1_assertion:assert property ( @(posedge clk) req inside {0, 1} ) ;
property proto_assertion ;
@(posedge clk) req |-> req[*1:$] ##0 ack;
endproperty
In the preceding example, signal req is specified with a distribution in assumption a1 and is converted to an
equivalent assertion a1_assertion.
It should be noted that the properties that are assumed shall hold in the same way with or without biasing.
When using an assume statement for random simulation, the biasing simply provides a means to select
values of free variables, according to the specified weights, when there is a choice of selection at a particular
time.
Consider an example specifying a simple synchronous request and acknowledge protocol, where variable
req can be raised at any time and shall stay asserted until ack is asserted. In the next clock cycle, both req
and ack shall be deasserted.
Properties governing req are as follows:
property pr1;
@(posedge clk) !reset_n |-> !req;
// when reset_n is asserted (0),
// keep req 0
endproperty
property pr2;
@(posedge clk) ack |=> !req;
// one cycle after ack, req
// shall be deasserted
endproperty
property pr3;
@(posedge clk) req |-> req[*1:$] ##0 ack; // hold req asserted until
// and including ack asserted
endproperty
Properties governing ack are as follows:
property pa1;
@(posedge clk) !reset_n || !req |-> !ack;
endproperty
property pa2;
@(posedge clk) ack |=> !ack;
endproperty
When verifying the behavior of a protocol controller that has to respond to requests on req, assertions

#### 16.14.3 Cover statement

There exist two categories of cover statements: cover sequence and cover property. The
cover sequence statement specifies sequence coverage, while the cover property statement specifies
property coverage. Both monitor behavioral aspects of the design for coverage. Tools shall collect coverage
information and report the results at the end of simulation or on demand via an assertion API (refer to
Clause 39). The difference between the two categories is that for sequence coverage, all matches per
evaluation attempt are reported, whereas for property coverage the coverage count is incremented at most
once per evaluation attempt. A cover statement may have an optional pass statement. The pass statement
shall not include any concurrent assert, assume, or cover statement.
For property coverage, the statement appears as follows:
cover property ( property_spec ) statement_or_null
The results of this coverage statement for a property shall contain the following:
—
Number of times attempted
—
Number of times succeeded (maximum of one per attempt)
—
Number of times succeeded because of vacuity
The pass statement specified in statement_or_null shall be executed once for each successful evaluation
attempt of the underlying property_spec. The pass statement shall be executed in the Reactive region of the
time step in which the corresponding evaluation attempt succeeds. The execution of statement_or_null can
be controlled by using assertion action control tasks. The assertion action control tasks are described in
20.11.
The preceding coverage counters for success or vacuous success do not include disabled evaluations. The
attempt counter includes the attempts that result in disabled evaluation. See 40.5.2 for details on obtaining
assertion coverage results.
For sequence coverage, the statement appears as follows:
cover sequence (
[ clocking_event ] [ disable iff ( expression_or_dist ) ] sequence_expr )
statement_or_null
Results of coverage for a sequence shall include the following:
—
Number of times attempted
—
Number of times matched (each attempt can generate multiple matches)
For a given attempt of the cover sequence statement, all matches of the sequence_expr that complete
without the occurrence of the disable iff condition shall be counted, with multiplicity, toward the total
number of times matched for the attempt. No other match shall be counted towards the total for the attempt.
The pass statement specified in statement_or_null shall be executed, with multiplicity, for each match that is

counted toward the total for the attempt. The pass statement shall be executed in the Reactive region of the
time step in which the corresponding match completes. The execution of statement_or_null can be
controlled by using assertion action control tasks. The assertion action control tasks are described in 20.11.
For a given attempt of the cover sequence statement, the total number of times matched for the attempt is
equal to the number of times increment_match_coverage() is executed in the corresponding attempt of
assert property (
[ clocking_event ] [ disable iff ( expression_or_dist ) ]
sequence_expr |-> ( 1'b1, increment_match_coverage() ) );
For each execution of increment_match_coverage(), the pass statement of the cover sequence
statement is executed in the Reactive region of the same time step.
#### 16.14.4 Restrict statement

In formal verification, for the tool to converge on a proof of a property or to initialize the design to a specific
state, it is often necessary to constrain the state space. For this purpose, the assertion statement restrict
property is introduced. It has the same semantics as assume property, however, in contrast to that
statement, the restrict property statement is not verified in simulation and has no action block.
The statement has the following form:
restrict property ( property_spec ) ;
There is no action block associated with the statement.
Example:
Suppose that when a control bit ctr has a value 0, an ALU performs an addition, and when it is 1, it
performs a subtraction. It is required to formally verify that some behavior is correct when ALU does an
addition (in another verification session it is possible to do the same for subtraction by changing the
restriction). The behavior can thus be constrained using the statement:
restrict property (@(posedge clk) ctr == '0);
It does not mean that ctr cannot be 1 in any test case in the simulation; that is not an error.
#### 16.14.5 Using concurrent assertion statements outside procedural code

A concurrent assertion statement can be used outside a procedural context. It can be used within a module,
an interface, or a program. A concurrent assertion statement is an assert, an assume, a cover, or a
restrict statement. Such a concurrent assertion statement uses the always semantics, meaning that it
specifies that a new evaluation attempt of the underlying property_spec begins at every occurrence of its
leading clock event.
The following two forms are equivalent:
assert property ( property_spec ) action_block
always assert property ( property_spec ) action_block ;
Similarly, the following two forms are equivalent:
cover property ( property_spec ) statement_or_null

always cover property ( property_spec ) statement_or_null
For example:
module top(input logic clk);
logic a,b,c;
property rule3;
@(posedge clk) a |-> b ##1 c;
endproperty
a1: assert property (rule3);
...
endmodule
rule3 is a property declared in module top. The assert statement a1 starts checking the property from
the beginning to the end of simulation. The property is always checked. Similarly,
module top(input logic clk);
logic a,b,c;
sequence seq3;
@(posedge clk) b ##1 c;
endsequence
c1: cover property (seq3);
...
endmodule
The cover statement c1 starts coverage of the sequence seq3 from beginning to the end of simulation. The
sequence is always monitored for coverage.
#### 16.14.6 Embedding concurrent assertions in procedural code

A concurrent assertion statement can also be embedded in a procedural block. For example:
property rule;
a ##1 b ##1 c;
endproperty
always @(posedge clk) begin
<statements>
assert property (rule);
end
The term procedural concurrent assertion is used to refer to any concurrent assertion statement (see 16.2)
that appears in procedural code. Unlike an immediate assertion, a procedural concurrent assertion is not
immediately evaluated when reached in procedural code. Instead, the assertion and the current values of all
constant and automatic expressions appearing in its assertion arguments (see 16.14.6.1) are placed in a
procedural assertion queue associated with the currently executing process. Each of the entries in this queue
is said to be a pending procedural assertion instance. It shall be illegal to use automatic variables in
clocking events. Since any given statement in a procedure may be executed multiple times (as in a loop, for
example), a particular procedural concurrent assertion may result in many pending procedural assertion
instances within a single time step. A concurrent assertion statement that appears outside procedural code is
referred to as a static concurrent assertion statement.
In the Observed region of each simulation time step, each pending procedural assertion instance that is
currently present in a procedural assertion queue shall mature, which means it is confirmed for execution.
When a pending procedural assertion instance matures, if the current time step is one that corresponds to that
assertion instance’s leading clocking event, an evaluation attempt of the assertion begins immediately within

the Observed region. If the assertion’s leading clocking event has not occurred in this time step, the matured
instance shall be placed on the matured assertion queue, which will cause the assertion to begin an
evaluation attempt upon the next clocking event that corresponds to the leading clocking event of the
assertion.
If a procedural assertion flush point (see 16.14.6.2) is reached in a process, its procedural assertion queue is
cleared. Any currently pending procedural assertion instances will not mature, unless again placed on the
queue in the course of procedural execution.
If no clocking event is specified in a procedural concurrent assertion, the leading clocking event of the
assertion shall be inferred from the procedural context, if possible. If no clock can be inferred from the
procedural context, then the clocks shall be inferred from the default clocking (14.12), as if the assertion
were instantiated immediately before the procedure.
A clock shall be inferred for the context of an always or initial procedure that satisfies the following
requirements:
a)
There is no blocking timing control in the procedure.
b)
There is exactly one event control in the procedure.
c)
One and only one event expression within the event control of the procedure satisfies both of the fol-
lowing conditions:
1) The event expression consists solely of an event variable, solely of a clocking block identifier,
or is of the form edge_identifier expression1 [ iff expression2 ] and is not a proper subexpres-
sion of an event expression of this form.
2) If the event expression consists solely of an event variable or clocking block identifier, it does
not appear anywhere else in the body of the procedure other than as a reference to a clocking
block signal, as a clocking event or within assertion statements. If the event expression is of the
form edge_identifier expression1 [ iff expression2 ], no term in expression1 appears anywhere
else in the body of the procedure other than as a clocking event or within assertion statements.
If these requirements are satisfied, then the unique event expression from the third requirement shall be the
clock inferred for the context of the procedure.
For example, in the following code fragment, the clocking event @(posedge mclk) is inferred as the
clocking event of r1_p1, while r1_p2 is clocked by @(posedge scanclk) as written:
property r1;
q != d;
endproperty
always @(posedge mclk) begin
q <= d1;
r1_p1: assert property (r1);
r1_p2: assert property (@(posedge scanclk)r1);
end
The resulting behavior of the preceding assertion r1_p2 depends on the relative frequencies of mclk and
scanclk. For example:
—
If scanclk runs at twice the frequency of mclk, only every other posedge of scanclk will result in
an evaluation of r1_p2. It is only queued when reached during procedural execution, which happens
on a rising edge of mclk.
—
If mclk runs at twice the frequency of scanclk, then by every posedge of scanclk, two pending
procedural instances of r1_p2 will mature. Thus every posedge of scanclk will see r1_p2
evaluated and results reported twice.

Also see 17.4 for the context clock inference in checkers, and 17.5 for examples of clock inference in
checker procedures.
Another, more complex example that is legal is as follows:
property r2;
q != d;
endproperty
always_ff @(posedge clock iff reset == 0 or posedge reset) begin
cnt <= reset ? 0 : cnt + 1;
q <= $past(d1);
r2_p: assert property (r2);
end
In the preceding example, the inferred clock is posedge clock iff reset == 0. The inferred clock is
not posedge clock because posedge clock is a proper subexpression of posedge clock iff
reset == 0.
In contrast, no clock is inferred for the context of the always_ff in the following:
property r3;
q != d;
endproperty
always_ff @(clock iff reset == 0 or posedge reset) begin
cnt <= reset ? 0 : cnt + 1;
q <= $past(d1);
// no inferred clock
r3_p: assert property (r3);
// no inferred clock
end
The edge expression posedge reset cannot be inferred because reset is referenced within the procedure,
and the expression clock iff reset == 0 cannot be inferred because it does not have an edge identifier.
In the absence of default clocking, the code above results in an error.
In the following example, no clock is inferred due to multiple event controls and delays in the always
procedure.
property r4;
q != d;
endproperty
always @(posedge mclk) begin
#10 q <= d1;
// delay prevents clock inference
@(negedge mclk)
// event control prevents clock inference
#10 q1 <= !d1;
r4_p: assert property (r4);
// no inferred clock
end
##### 16.14.6.1 Arguments to procedural concurrent assertions

A procedural concurrent assertion saves the value of its const expressions and automatic variables at the
time the assertion evaluation attempt is added to the procedural assertion queue. This assertion evaluation
attempt uses these saved values for the evaluation, in contrast to static variables, which are sampled in the
Preponed region (see 16.5.1). For example:

// Assume for this example that (posedge clk) will not occur at time 0
always @(posedge clk) begin
   // variable declared outside for statement is static (see 6.21)
int i;
for (i=0; i<10; i++) begin
a1: assert property (foo[i] && bar[i]);
a2: assert property (foo[const'(i)] && bar[i]);
a3: assert property (foo[const'(i)] && bar[const'(i)]);
end
end
In any given clock cycle, each of these assertions will result in 10 queued executions. Every execution of
assertion a1 after the first clock cycle, however, will be checking the value of (foo[10] && bar[10]),
since the sampled value of i from the Preponed region will always be 10, its final value from the previous
execution of the always procedure. (In the first clock cycle, the sampled value of i will be 0, its default
value.)
In the case of a2, its executions (after the first clock cycle) will be checking (foo[0] && bar[10]),
(foo[1] && bar[10]), ... (foo[9] && bar[10]). Assertion a3, since it has const casts on both uses
of i, will be checking (foo[0] && bar[0]), (foo[1] && bar[1]), ... (foo[9] && bar[9]). So the
preceding code fragment is logically equivalent (aside from instance names and the first clock cycle) to the
following:
default clocking @(posedge clk); endclocking
generate for (genvar i=0; i<10; i++) begin
a1: assert property (foo[10] && bar[10]);
a2: assert property (foo[i] && bar[10]);
a3: assert property (foo[i] && bar[i]);
end
endgenerate
Since automatic variables also have their immediate values preserved, in the following example, all three
properties a4, a5, and a6 are logically equivalent:
always @(posedge clk) begin
// variable declared in for statement is automatic (see 12.7.1)
for (int i=0; i<10; i++) begin
a4: assert property (foo[i] && bar[i]);
a5: assert property (foo[const'(i)] && bar[i]);
a6: assert property (foo[const'(i)] && bar[const'(i)]);
end
end
When a procedural concurrent assertion contains temporal expressions and has matured, the execution flow
of the procedure no longer directly affects the matured instance in future time steps. In other words, the
procedural execution only affects the activation of the assertion instance, not the completion of temporal
expressions in the future. However, any constant values that were passed into the assertion instance due to
constant or automatic variables will remain constant for the duration of that instance’s evaluation. The
following example illustrates this behavior:
wire w;
always @(posedge clk) begin : procedural_block_1
if (my_activation_condition == 1) begin
for (int i=0; i<2; i++) begin
a7: assume property (foo[i] |=> bar[i] ##1 (w==1'b1));
end
end

485

end
During the time step when my_activation_condition is 1, two pending instances of a7 will be placed
on the procedural assertion queue, one for each value of i. Assume that they successfully mature, and
foo[0] is true in the current time step. This means that on the next posedge of clk, regardless of the
execution of procedural_block_1 or the value of my_activation_condition, that matured instance
of a7 will be checking that bar[0] is true. The constant value of the automatic i from when the assertion
was queued is still in effect, for this and any future clock cycles of this assertion evaluation. Then, one cycle
later, the assertion will also be checking that the sampled value of w is 1'b1.
The same rules that apply to procedural concurrent assertion arguments also apply to variables appearing in
their action blocks. Thus, constant or automatic values may be used in action blocks as well as the assertion
statements themselves, where they behave as inputs to the action block that shall not be modified. The
following example illustrates this behavior:
// Assume for this example that (posedge clk) will not occur at time 0
always @(posedge clk) begin
int i;
for (i=0; i<10; i++) begin
a8: assert property (foo[const'(i)] && bar[i]) else
$error("a8 failed for const i=%d and i=%d",
const'(i), $sampled(i));
end
end
Upon a failure, any instance of the preceding assertion will show the constant value of i (may be from 0 to
9) that was used in that instance for “const i=”, while the string printed will always end in “i=10” (after
the first clock cycle), since 10 will be the sampled value captured from the Preponed region.
When embedding procedural concurrent assertions in code using conditionals, it is important to remember
that the current values of the conditionals in the procedure are used, rather than the sampled values. This
contrasts with the assertion’s expressions, where sampled values are used (see 16.5.1). The following
example illustrates this situation:
// Assume a, b, c, and en are not automatic
always @(posedge clk) begin
en = ...;
if (en) begin
a9: assert property p1(a,b,c);
end
if ($sampled(en)) begin
a10: assert property p1(a,b,c);
end
end
Assertion a9 is queued on any time step when en becomes true, while a10 is queued on any time step when
the sampled value of en was true. Thus, assuming nothing else in the code modifies en, checks of a10 will
happen a time step later than checks on a9, even though both use the sampled values of a, b, and c on their
respective time steps.
NOTE—This is an area of backwards-incompatibility between this standard and 17.13 of IEEE Std 1800-2005. In the
## 2005 definition, en would have been detected as the inferred enabling condition (a definition that no longer exists in this

standard) of a9 and always sampled, so a9 and a10 would have identical behavior.
##### 16.14.6.2 Procedural assertion flush points

A process is defined to have reached a procedural assertion flush point if any of the following occur:
Authorized licensed use limited to: Richard DJE. Downloaded on February 27,2026 at 08:44:11 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.
IEEE Std 1800-2023
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
486
Copyright © 2024 IEEE. All rights reserved.
—
The process, having been suspended earlier due to reaching an event control or wait statement,
resumes execution.
—
The process was declared by an always_comb or always_latch, and its execution is resumed due
to a transition on one of its dependent signals.
—
The outermost scope of the process is disabled by a disable statement (see 16.14.6.4).
The following example shows how procedural concurrent assertions inherently avoid multiple evaluations
due to transitional combinational values in a single simulation time step:
assign not_a = !a;
default clocking @(posedge clk); endclocking
always_comb begin : b1
// Probably better to not use consts in this example
// ...but using them to illustrate effects of flushing method
a1: assert property (const'(not_a) != const'(a));
end
When a changes in a time step during which a positive clock edge occurs, a simulator could evaluate
assertion a1 twice—once for the change in a and once for the change in not_a after the evaluation of the
continuous assignment. The first execution of a1, which would have ended up reporting a failure, will be
scheduled on the process’s procedural assertion queue. When not_a changes, the procedural assertion
queue is flushed due to the activation of b1, and a new pending instance of the procedural concurrent
assertion will now be queued with the correct values, so no failure of a1 will be reported.
The following example illustrates the behavior of procedural concurrent assertions in the presence of time
delays:
default clocking @(posedge clk); endclocking
always @(a or b) begin : b1
a2: assert property (a == b) r.success(0) else r.error(0, a, b);
#1;
a3: assert property (a == b) r.success(1) else r.error(1, a, b);
end
In this case, due to the time delay in the middle of the procedure, an Observed region will always be reached
after the queueing of a2 and before a flush point. Thus a2 will always mature. For a3, during time steps
where either a or b changes after it has been queued, the assertion will always be flushed from the queue and
never mature. In general, procedural concurrent assertions need to be used carefully when mixed with time
delays.
The following example illustrates a typical use of a procedural concurrent assertion statement with a cover
rather than an assert:
assign a = ...;
assign b = ...;
default clocking @(posedge clk); endclocking
always_comb begin : b1
...
c1: cover property (const'(b) != const'(a));
end
In this example, the goal is to make sure some test is covering the case where a and b have different values
at that point in the procedural code. Due to the arbitrary order of the assignments in the simulator, it might be
the case that in a cycle where there is a positive clock edge and both variables are being assigned the same
value, b1 executes while a has been assigned but b still holds its previous value. Thus c1 will be queued, but

this is actually a glitch, and probably not a useful piece of coverage information. But, when b1 is executed
the next time (after b has also been assigned its new value), that coverage point will be flushed, and when
the coverage point matures, c2 will correctly not get reported as having been covered during that time step.
##### 16.14.6.3 Procedural concurrent assertions and glitches

One common concern with assertion execution is glitches, where the same assertion executes multiple times
in a time step and reports undesired failures on temporary values that have not yet received their final values
for the step. In general, procedural concurrent assertions are immune to glitches due to order of procedural
execution due to the flushing mechanism, but are still subject to glitches caused by execution loops between
regions.
For example, if code in the Reactive region modifies signals and causes another pass to the Active region to
occur, this may create some glitching behavior, as the new passage in the Active region may requeue
procedural concurrent assertions, and a second evaluation attempt may be added to the matured assertion
queue. The following code illustrates this situation.
always_comb begin : procedural_block_1
if (en)
foo = bar;
end
always_comb begin : procedural_block_2
p1: assert property ( @(posedge clk) (const'(foo) == const'(bar)) );
end
Suppose bar is assigned a new value elsewhere in the code at the posedge of the clock, and en is 1 so the
assignment in procedural_block_1 takes place. Block procedural_block_2 may be executed twice in
the Active region: once upon the initial change to bar, and once after the assignment that updates foo.
Upon the first execution of procedural_block_2, a pending instance of p1 will be queued and would
result in failure of the assertion if it matured. But this instance will be flushed upon the second execution of
the procedural block before maturing, and thus there will be no glitch.
However, now suppose that in the same example, en is 0, and the assignment of the bar value to foo
happens through VPI code in the Reactive region. In this case, the Observed region has already occurred, so
p1 has matured and executed, and reported the assertion failure due to foo and bar having different values.
After the Reactive region, there will be another Active region in which procedural_block_2 will be
executed, and this time a newly queued instance of p1 will pass. But this is too late to prevent the report of
the failure earlier in the time step.
##### 16.14.6.4 Disabling procedural concurrent assertions

The disable statement shall interact with procedural concurrent assertions as follows:
—
A specific procedural concurrent assertion may be disabled. Any pending procedural instances of
that assertion are cleared from the queue. Any pending procedural instances of other assertions
remain in the queue.
—
When a disable is applied to the outermost scope of a procedure that has a pending procedural
assertion queue, in addition to normal disable activities (see 9.6.2), the pending procedural assertion
queue is flushed and all pending assertion instances on the queue are cleared.
Once a procedural concurrent assertion evaluation attempt has matured, it shall not be impacted by any
disable.

Disabling a task or a non-outermost scope of a procedure does not cause flushing of any pending procedural
assertion instances.
The following example illustrates how user code can explicitly flush a pending procedural assertion
instance. In this case, instances of a1 only mature in time steps where bad_val_ok does not settle at a value
of 1.
default clocking @(posedge clk); endclocking
always @(bad_val or bad_val_ok) begin : b1
a1: assert property (bad_val) else $fatal(1, "Sorry");
if (bad_val_ok) begin
disable a1;
end
end
The following example illustrates how user code can explicitly flush all pending procedural assertion
instances on the procedural assertion queue of process b2:
default clocking @(posedge clk); endclocking
always @(a or b or c) begin : b2
if (c == 8'hff) begin
a2: assert property (a && b);
end else begin
a3: assert property (a || b);
end
end
always @(clear_b2) begin : b3
disable b2;
end
#### 16.14.7 Inferred clocking and disable functions

The following elaboration-time system functions are available to query the inferred clocking event and
disable condition:
—
$inferred_clock returns the inferred clocking event.
—
$inferred_disable returns the inferred disable condition.
The inferred clocking event is the current resolved event expression that can be used in a clocking event
definition. It is obtained by applying clock flow rules to the point where $inferred_clock is called. If
there is no current resolved event expression when $inferred_clock is encountered then an error shall be
issued.
The inferred disable condition is the disable condition from the default disable iff declaration whose
scope includes the call to $inferred_disable (see 16.15). If the call to $inferred_disable is not
within the scope of any default disable iff declaration, then the call to $inferred_disable returns
1'b0 (false).
An inferred clocking or disable function shall only be used as the entire default value expression for a formal
argument to a property, sequence, or checker declaration. $inferred_clock shall only be used as the
default value for a formal argument that is untyped or of type event.
An inferred clocking or disable function call is replaced by the inferred expression as determined at the point
where the property, sequence, or checker is instantiated. Thus, if a property or sequence instance is the top-
level property expression in an assertion statement, the event expression that is used to replace

$inferred_clock is that as determined at the location of the assertion statement. Otherwise, the event
expression used is that determined by clock flow rules up to the instance location in the property expression.
Similarly, if $inferred_clock is used as the default value in a checker, the event expression that is used is
that as determined at the location of the checker instance.
Consider the following example:
module m(logic a, b, c, d, rst1, clk1, clk2);
logic rst;
default clocking @(negedge clk1); endclocking

a3: assert property

(a ##0 b[->1]) |=> c
);
a4: assert property (@(negedge clk2) a ##1 @(negedge clk1) b |=>
@(posedge clk1) c ##1 d);
endmodule
In assertion a1 the clock event is inferred from the default clocking, therefore $inferred_clock is
negedge clk1 for a1. In assertion a2 the event expression posedge clk1 is passed to the formal
argument clk in the instance of property p_triggers. Therefore, the $inferred_clock is not used for
clk in that instance. In assertion a3 the clocking event is inferred from the event control of the always
procedure, therefore $inferred_clock is posedge clk2 for a3.
In assertion a4, as the property p_multiclock is instantiated in the assert property statement, clkw is
replaced by the actual argument (negedge clk2),
clkx by the default argument value
$inferred_clock, which is the default clocking clock (negedge clk1) at the location of the property
instance in the assertion. The third clock, clky, is replaced by the actual argument (posedge clk1)
because it is explicitly specified.
The disable condition rst1 is inferred for assertions a1 and a3 from the default disable iff
statement. Assertion a2 uses explicit reset value 1'b0 in which case the disable iff statement could be
omitted altogether in the equivalent assertion.
#### 16.14.8 Nonvacuous evaluations

An evaluation attempt of a property is either vacuous or nonvacuous. In particular, a vacuous success on all
evaluation attempts may indicate a potential problem either in the design or in the formulation of the
property. For example,
a |-> b
is evaluated as a vacuous success when a is false. In that case the evaluation is independent of the value of b;
even though it is a successful evaluation, the property behavior is interpreted as not matching the user intent,
meaning that an assertion of this property is not considered a pass or a failure.
For a general property, nonvacuous evaluation is defined recursively on the structure of the property as
follows:
a)
An evaluation attempt of a property that is a sequence is always nonvacuous.
b)
An evaluation attempt of a property of the form strong(sequence_expr) is always nonvacuous.
c)
An evaluation attempt of a property of the form weak(sequence_expr) is always nonvacuous.
d)
An evaluation attempt of a property of the form not property_expr is nonvacuous if, and only if, the
underlying evaluation attempt of property_expr is nonvacuous.
e)
An evaluation attempt of a property of the form property_expr1 or property_expr2 is nonvacuous
if, and only if, either the underlying evaluation attempt of property_expr1 is nonvacuous or the
underlying evaluation attempt of property_expr2 is nonvacuous.
f)
An evaluation attempt of a property of the form property_expr1 and property_expr2 is nonvacuous
if, and only if, either the underlying evaluation attempt of property_expr1 is nonvacuous or the
underlying evaluation attempt of property_expr2 is nonvacuous.

### 16.15 Disable iff resolution

```ebnf
module_or_generate_item_declaration ::=
```

// from A.1.4
...
| default disable iff expression_or_dist ;
Syntax 16-19—Default disable syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
A default disable iff may be declared within a generate block or within a module, interface, or
program declaration. It provides a default disable condition to all concurrent assertions in the scope and
subscopes of the default disable iff declaration. Furthermore, the default extends to any nested
module, interface, or program declarations, and to nested generate blocks. However, if a nested module,
interface, or program declaration, or a generate block itself has a default disable iff declaration, then
that default disable iff applies within the nested declaration or generate block and overrides any
default disable iff from outside. Any signals referenced in the disable iff declaration that are
resolved using scopes will be resolved from the scope of the declaration.
The effect of a default disable iff declaration is independent of the position of the declaration within
that scope. More than one default disable iff declaration within the same module, interface, program
declaration, or generate block shall be an error. The scope does not extend into any instances of modules,
interfaces, or programs.
In the following example, module m1 declares rst1 to be the default disable condition, and there is no
default disable iff declaration in the nested module m2. The default disable condition rst1 applies
throughout the declaration of m1 and the nested declaration of m2. Therefore, the inferred disable condition
of both assertions a1 and a2 is rst1.
module m1;
bit clk, rst1;
default disable iff rst1;
a1: assert property (@(posedge clk) p1);
// property p1 is
// defined elsewhere

...
module m2;
bit rst2;
...
a2: assert property (@(posedge clk) p2);
// property p2 is
// defined elsewhere
endmodule
...
endmodule
If there is a default disable iff declaration in the nested module m2, then within m2 this default disable
condition overrides the default disable condition declared in m1. Therefore, in the following example the
inferred disable condition of a1 is rst1, but the inferred disable condition of a2 is rst2.
module m1;
bit clk, rst1;
default disable iff rst1;
a1: assert property (@(posedge clk) p1);
// property p1 is
// defined elsewhere
...
module m2;
bit rst2;
default disable iff rst2;
...
a2: assert property (@(posedge clk) p2);
// property p2 is
// defined elsewhere
endmodule
...
endmodule
The following rules apply for resolution of the disable condition:
a)
If an assertion has a disable iff clause, then the disable condition specified in this clause shall be
used and any default disable iff declaration ignored for this assertion.
b)
If an assertion does not contain a disable iff clause, but the assertion is within the scope of a
default disable iff declaration, then the disable condition for the assertion is inferred from the
default disable iff declaration.
c)
Otherwise, no inference is performed (this is equivalent to the inference of a 1'b0 disable
condition).
Following are two example modules illustrating the application of these rules:
module examples_with_default (input logic a, b, clk, rst, rst1);
default disable iff rst;
property p1;
disable iff (rst1) a |=> b;
endproperty
// Disable condition is rst1 - explicitly specified within a1
a1 : assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (rst1) a |=> b);
// Disable condition is rst1 - explicitly specified within p1
a2 : assert property (@(posedge clk) p1);
// Disable condition is rst - no explicit specification, inferred from
// default disable iff declaration
a3 : assert property (@(posedge clk) a |=> b);

// Disable condition is 1'b0. This is the only way to
// cancel the effect of default disable.
a4 : assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (1'b0) a |=> b);
endmodule
module examples_without_default (input logic a, b, clk, rst);
property p2;
disable iff (rst) a |=> b;
endproperty
// Disable condition is rst - explicitly specified within a5
a5 : assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (rst) a |=> b);
// Disable condition is rst - explicitly specified within p2
a6 : assert property (@ (posedge clk) p2);
// No disable condition
a7 : assert property (@ (posedge clk) a |=> b);
endmodule
### 16.16 Clock resolution

There are a number of ways to specify a clock for a property. They are as follows:
—
Sequence instance with a clock, for example:
sequence s2; @(posedge clk) a ##2 b; endsequence
property p2; not s2; endproperty
assert property (p2);
—
Property, for example:
property p3; @(posedge clk) not (a ##2 b); endproperty
assert property (p3);
—
Contextually inferred clock from a procedural block, for example:
always @(posedge clk) assert property (not (a ##2 b));
—
A clocking block, for example:
clocking primary_clk @(posedge clk);
property p3; not (a ##2 b); endproperty
endclocking
assert property (primary_clk.p3);
—
Default clock, for example:
default clocking primary_clk ;
// primary clock as defined above
property p4; (a ##2 b); endproperty
assert property (p4);
In general, a clocking event applies throughout its scope except where superseded by an inner clocking
event, as with clock flow in multiclocked sequences and properties. The following rules apply (the term

maximal property, used in the rules below, is defined as the unique flattened property contained in the
assertion statement and obtained by applying the rewriting algorithm in F.4.1):
a)
In a module, interface, program, or checker with a default clocking event, a concurrent assertion
statement that has no otherwise specified leading clocking event is treated as though the default
clocking event had been written explicitly as the leading clocking event. The default clocking event
does not apply to a sequence or property declaration except in the case that the declaration appears
in a clocking block whose clocking event is the default.
b)
The following rules apply within a clocking block:
1)
No explicit clocking event is allowed in any property or sequence declaration within the
clocking block. All sequence and property declarations within the clocking block are treated as
though the clocking event of the clocking block had been written explicitly as the leading
clocking event.
2)
Multiclocked sequences and properties are not allowed within the clocking block.
3)
If a named sequence or property that is declared outside the clocking block is instantiated
within the clocking block, the instance shall be singly clocked and its clocking event shall be
identical to that of the clocking block.
c)
A contextually inferred clocking event from a procedural block supersedes a default clocking event.
The contextually inferred clocking event is treated as though it had been written as the leading
clocking event of any concurrent assertion statement to which the inferred clock applies.
d)
An explicitly specified leading clocking event in a concurrent assertion statement supersedes a
default clocking event.
e)
A multiclocked sequence or property can inherit the default clocking event as its leading clocking
event. If a multiclocked property is the maximal property of a concurrent assertion statement, then
the property shall have a unique semantic leading clock (see 16.16.1).
f)
If a concurrent assertion statement has no explicit leading clocking event, there is no default
clocking event, and no contextually inferred clocking event applies to the assertion statement, then
the maximal property of the assertion statement shall be an instance of a sequence or property for
which a unique leading clocking event is determined.
The following are two example modules illustrating the application of these rules with some legal and some
illegal declarations, as indicated by the comments:
module examples_with_default (input logic a, b, c, clk);
property q1;
$rose(a) |-> ##[1:5] b;

#### 16.16.1 Semantic leading clocks for multiclocked sequences and properties

Throughout this subclause, s, s1, and s2 denote sequences without clocking events; p, p1, and p2 denote
properties without clocking events; m, m1, and m2 denote multiclocked sequences, q, q1, and q2 denote
multiclocked properties; and c, c1, and c2 denote nonidentical clocking event expressions.
This subclause defines a notion of the set of semantic leading clocks for a multiclocked sequence or
property.
Some sequences and properties have no explicit leading clock event. Their initial clocking event is inherited
from an outer clocking event according to the flow of clocking event scope. In this case, the semantic
leading clock is said to be inherited. For example, in the property
@(c) s |=> p and @(c1) p1
the semantic leading clock of the subproperty p is inherited because the initial clock of p is the clock that
flows across |=>.
A multiclocked sequence has a unique semantic leading clock, defined inductively as follows:
—
The semantic leading clock of s is inherited.
—
The semantic leading clock of @(c) s is c.
—
If inherited is the semantic leading clock of m, then the semantic leading clock of @(c) m is c.
Otherwise, the semantic leading clock of @(c) m is equal to the semantic leading clock of m.

—
The semantic leading clock of (m) is equal to the semantic leading clock of m.
—
The semantic leading clock of m1 ##1 m2 is equal to the semantic leading clock of m1.
—
The semantic leading clock of m1 ##0 m2 is equal to the semantic leading clock of m1.
The set of semantic leading clocks of a multiclocked property is defined inductively as follows:
—
The set of semantic leading clocks of strong(m) is {c}, where c is the unique semantic leading
clock of m.
—
The set of semantic leading clocks of weak(m) is {c}, where c is the unique semantic leading clock
of m.
—
The set of semantic leading clocks of p is {inherited}.
—
If inherited is an element of the set of semantic leading clocks of q, then the set of semantic leading
clocks of @(c) q is obtained from the set of semantic leading clocks of q by replacing inherited by c.
Otherwise, the set of semantic leading clocks of @(c) q is equal to the set of semantic leading clocks
of q.
—
The set of semantic leading clocks of (q) is equal to the set of semantic leading clocks of q.
—
The set of semantic leading clocks of not q is equal to the set of semantic leading clocks of q.

The set of semantic leading clocks of a property instance is equal to the set of semantic leading
clocks of the multiclocked property obtained from the body of its declaration by substituting in
actual arguments.
For example, the multiclocked sequence
@(c1) s1 ##1 @(c2) s2
has c1 as its unique semantic leading clock, while the multiclocked property
not (p1 and (@(c2) p2)
has {inherited, c2} as its set of semantic leading clocks.

In the presence of an incoming outer clock, the inherited semantic leading clock is always understood to
refer to the incoming outer clock. Therefore, the clocking of a property q in the presence of incoming outer
clock c is equivalent to the clocking of the property @(c) q.
A multiclocked property has a unique semantic leading clock in cases where all its leading clocks are
identical. Consider the following example:
wire clk1, clk2;
logic a, b;
...
assign clk2 = clk1;
a1: assert property (@(clk1) a and @(clk2) b); // Illegal
a2: assert property (@(clk1) a and @(clk1) b); // OK
always @(posedge clk1) begin
a3: assert property(a and @(posedge clk2)); //Illegal
a4: assert property(a and @(posedge clk1)); // OK
end
The assertions a2 and a4 are legal, while the assertions a1 and a3 are not. Though both clocks of a1 have
the same value, they are not identical. Therefore, a1 does not have a unique semantic leading clock. The
assertions a3 and a4 have @(posedge clk1) as their inferred clock. This clock is not identical to
@(posedge clk2) therefore a3 does not have a unique semantic leading clock.
### 16.17 Expect statement

The expect statement is a procedural blocking statement that allows waiting on a property evaluation. The
syntax of the expect statement accepts a named property or a property declaration and is given in
Syntax 16-20.
```ebnf
expect_property_statement ::= expect ( property_spec ) action_block
```

// from A.2.10
Syntax 16-20—Expect statement syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The expect statement accepts the same syntax used to assert a property. An expect statement causes the
executing process to block until the given property succeeds or fails. The statement following the expect is
scheduled to execute after processing the Observed region in which the property completes its evaluation.
When the property succeeds or fails, the process unblocks, and the property stops being evaluated (i.e., no
property evaluation is started until that expect statement is executed again).
When executed, the expect statement starts a single thread of evaluation for the given property on the
subsequent clocking event, that is, the first evaluation shall take place on the next clocking event. If the
else clause is omitted, the tool shall call $error when the assertion fails, unless $assertcontrol is used
to suppress the failure (see 20.11). If the property fails at its clocking event, the optional else clause of the
action block is executed. If the property succeeds, the optional pass statement of the action block is
executed. The execution of pass and fail statements can be controlled by using assertion action control tasks.
The assertion action control tasks are described in 20.11.
program tst;
initial begin
# 200ms;
expect( @(posedge clk) a ##1 b ##1 c ) else $error( "expect failed" );
ABC: ...
end

endprogram
In the preceding example, the expect statement specifies a property that consists of the sequence a ##1 b
##1 c. The expect statement (second statement in the initial procedure of program tst) blocks until
the sequence a ##1 b ##1 c is matched or is determined not to match. The property evaluation starts on
the occurrence of the posedge clk event following the 200 ms delay. If the sequence is matched, the
process is unblocked and continues to execute on the statement labeled ABC. If the sequence fails to match,
then the else clause is executed, which in this case generates a run-time error. For the preceding expect
statement to succeed, the sequence a ##1 b ##1 c needs to match starting on the occurrence of the
posedge clk event immediately after time 200ms. The sequence will not match if a, b, or c is evaluated to
be false at the first, second, or third clocking event occurrence, respectively.
The expect statement can appear anywhere a wait statement (see 9.4.3) can appear. Because it is a
blocking statement, the property can refer to automatic variables as well as static variables. For example, the
task below waits between 1 and 10 clock ticks for the variable data to equal a particular value, which is
specified by the automatic argument value. The second argument, success, is used to return the result of
the expect statement: 1 for success and 0 for failure.
integer data;
...
task automatic wait_for( integer value, output bit success );
expect( @(posedge clk) ##[1:10] data == value ) success = 1;
else success = 0;
endtask
initial begin
bit ok;
wait_for( 23, ok );
// wait for the value 23
...
end
### 16.18 Clocking blocks and concurrent assertions

If a variable used in a concurrent assertion is a clocking block variable, it will be sampled only in the
clocking block.
Examples:
module A;
logic a, clk;
clocking cb_with_input @(posedge clk);
input a;
property p1;
a;
endproperty
endclocking
clocking cb_without_input @(posedge clk);
property p1;
a;
endproperty
endclocking
property p1;
@(posedge clk) a;
endproperty

property p2;
@(posedge clk) cb_with_input.a;
endproperty
a1: assert property (p1);
a2: assert property (cb_with_input.p1);
a3: assert property (p2);
a4: assert property (cb_without_input.p1);
endmodule
Figure 16-17 explains the behavior of all the assertions. In the preceding example, a1, a2, a3, and a4 are
equivalent.
