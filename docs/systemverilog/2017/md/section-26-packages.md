This clause describes the following:
—
Package declarations
—
Referencing data within packages
—
Package search order rules
—
Exporting imported names from packages
—
The std built-in package
### 26.2 Package declarations

SystemVerilog packages provide an additional mechanism for sharing parameters, data, type, task, function,
sequence, property, and checker declarations among multiple SystemVerilog modules, interfaces, programs,
and checkers.
Packages are explicitly named scopes appearing at the outermost level of the source text (at the same level as
top-level modules and primitives). Types, nets, variables, tasks, functions, sequences, properties, and
checkers may be declared within a package. Such declarations may be referenced within modules,
interfaces, programs, checkers, and other packages by either import or fully resolved name.
Packages may contain processes inside checkers only. Therefore, net declarations with implicit continuous
assignments are not allowed.

the same time scope.
Syntax 26-1—Package declaration syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The package declaration creates a scope that contains declarations intended to be shared among one or
more compilation units, modules, interfaces, or programs. Items within packages are generally type
definitions, tasks, and functions. Items within packages shall not have hierarchical references to identifiers
except those created within the package or made visible by import of another package. A package shall not
refer to items defined in the compilation unit scope. (See 3.12.1.) It is also possible to populate packages
with parameters, variables, and nets. This may be useful for global items that are not conveniently passed
down through the hierarchy. Variable declaration assignments within the package shall occur before any
initial or always procedures are started, in the same way as variables declared in a compilation unit or
module.
The following is an example of a package:
package ComplexPkg;
typedef struct {
shortreal i, r;
} Complex;
function Complex add(Complex a, b);
add.r = a.r + b.r;
add.i = a.i + b.i;
endfunction
function Complex mul(Complex a, b);
mul.r = (a.r * b.r) - (a.i * b.i);
mul.i = (a.r * b.i) + (a.i * b.r);
endfunction
endpackage : ComplexPkg
### 26.3 Referencing data in packages

The compilation of a package shall precede the compilation of scopes in which the package is imported.
One  way  to  use  declarations  made  in a package is to reference them using the package scope resolution
operator ::.
ComplexPkg::Complex cout = ComplexPkg::mul(a, b);
An alternate method for utilizing package declarations is via the import declaration (see Syntax 26-2).

11) It shall be illegal to have an import statement directly within a class scope.
Syntax 26-2—Package import syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
The import declaration provides direct visibility of identifiers within packages. It allows identifiers
declared within packages to be visible within the current scope without a package name qualifier. Two
forms of the import declaration are provided: explicit import and wildcard import. Explicit import allows
control over precisely which symbols are imported:
import ComplexPkg::Complex;
import ComplexPkg::add;
An explicit import only imports the symbols specifically referenced by the import.
In the following example, the import of the enumeration type teeth_t does not import the enumeration
literals ORIGINAL and FALSE. In order to refer to the enumeration literal FALSE from package q, either add
import q::FALSE or use a full package reference as in teeth = q::FALSE;.
package p;
typedef enum { FALSE, TRUE } bool_t;
endpackage
package q;
typedef enum { ORIGINAL, FALSE } teeth_t;
endpackage
module top1 ;
import p::*;
import q::teeth_t;
teeth_t myteeth;
initial begin
myteeth = q:: FALSE; // OK:
myteeth = FALSE;
// ERROR: Direct reference to FALSE refers to the
end
// FALSE enumeration literal imported from p
endmodule
module top2 ;
import p::*;
import q::teeth_t, q::ORIGINAL, q::FALSE;
teeth_t myteeth;

initial begin
myteeth = FALSE;
// OK: Direct reference to FALSE refers to the
end
// FALSE enumeration literal imported from q
endmodule
An explicit import shall be illegal if the imported identifier is declared in the same scope or explicitly
imported from another package. Importing an identifier from the same package multiple times is allowed.
A wildcard import allows all identifiers declared within a package to be imported provided the identifier is
not otherwise defined in the importing scope: A wildcard import is of the following form:
import ComplexPkg::*;
An identifier is potentially locally visible at some point within a scope if there is a wildcard import of a
package before that point within the current scope and the package contains a declaration of that identifier.
An identifier is locally visible at some point within a scope if
a)
The identifier denotes a nested scope within the current scope, or
b)
The identifier is declared as an identifier prior to that point within the current scope, or
c)
The identifier is visible from an explicit import prior to that point within the current scope.
A potentially locally visible identifier from a wildcard import may become locally visible if the resolution of
a reference to an identifier finds no other matching locally visible identifiers.
For a reference to an identifier other than function or task call, the locally visible identifiers defined at the
point of the reference in the current scope shall be searched. If the reference is a function or task call, all of
the locally visible identifiers to the end of the current scope shall be searched. If a match is found, the
reference shall be bound to that locally visible identifier.
If no locally visible identifiers match, then the potentially locally visible identifiers defined prior to the point
of the reference in the current scope shall be searched. If a match is found, that identifier from the package
shall be imported into the current scope, becoming a locally visible identifier within the current scope, and
the reference shall be bound to that identifier.
If the reference is not bound within the current scope, the next outer lexical scope shall be searched; first
from among the locally visible identifiers in that scope and then from among the potentially locally visible
identifiers defined prior to the point of the reference. If a match is found among the potentially locally
visible identifiers, that identifier from the package shall be imported into the outer scope, becoming a locally
visible identifier within the outer scope.
If a wildcard imported symbol is made locally visible in a scope, any later locally visible declaration of the
same name in that scope shall be illegal.
The search algorithm shall be repeated for each outer lexical scope until an identifier is found that matches
the reference or there are no more outer lexical scopes, the compilation unit scope being the final scope
searched. For a reference to an identifier other than function or task call, it shall be illegal if no identifier can
be found that matches the reference. If the reference is a function or task call, the search continues using
upwards hierarchical identifier resolution (see 23.8.1).
It shall be illegal if the wildcard import of more than one package within the same scope defines the same
potentially locally visible identifier and a search for a reference matches that identifier.

Example 1:
package p;
int x;
endpackage
module top;
import p::*;
// line 1
if (1) begin : b
initial x = 1;
// line 2
int x;
// line 3
initial x = 1;
// line 4
end
int x;
// line 5
endmodule
The reference in line 2 causes the potentially locally visible x from wildcard import p::* ( p::x ) to
become locally visible in scope top, and line 2 initializes p::x. Line 4 initializes top.b.x. Line 5 is illegal
since it is a local declaration in scope top, which conflicts with the name x imported from p, which had
already become a locally visible declaration.
Example 2:
package p;
int x;
endpackage
package p2;
int x;
endpackage
module top;
import p::*;
// line 1
if (1) begin : b
initial x = 1;
// line 2
import p2::*;
// line 3
 end
endmodule
Line 2 causes the import of p::x in scope top because the wildcard import p::* is in the outer scope top
and precedes the occurrence of x. The declaration x from package p becomes locally visible in scope top.
Example 3:
package p;
function int f();
return 1;
endfunction
endpackage
module top;
int x;
if (1) begin : b
initial x = f();
// line 2
import p::*;
// line 3
end

function int f();
return 1;
endfunction
endmodule
f() on line 2 binds to top.f and not to p::f since the import is after the function call reference.
Example 4:
package p;
function int f();
return 1;
endfunction
endpackage
package p2;
function int f();
return 1;
endfunction
endpackage
module top;
import p::*;
int x;
if (1) begin : b
initial x = f();
// line 1
end
import p2::*;
endmodule
Since f is not found in scope b, the rules require inspection of all wildcard imports in the parent scope.
There are two wildcard imports, but only the wildcard import p::* that is lexically preceding the occurrence
of f() is considered. In this case, f binds to p::f.
The effect of importing an identifier into a scope makes that identifier visible without requiring access using
the scope resolution operator. Importing does not copy the declaration of that identifier into the importing
scope. The imported identifier shall not be visible outside that importing scope by hierarchical reference into
that scope or by interface port reference into that scope.
It shall be illegal to have an import statement directly within a class scope.
### 26.4 Using packages in module headers

Package items can be referenced in module, interface or program parameter and port declarations by
importing the package as part of the header to the module, interface, or program declaration. The syntax is
shown in Syntax 26-3.
```ebnf
module_nonansi_header ::=
```

// from A.1.2
{ attribute_instance } module_keyword [ lifetime ] module_identifier
{ package_import_declaration } [ parameter_port_list ] list_of_ports ;
```ebnf
module_ansi_header ::=
```

{ attribute_instance } module_keyword [ lifetime ] module_identifier
{ package_import_declaration }1 [ parameter_port_list ] [ list_of_port_declarations ] ;

```ebnf
interface_nonansi_header ::=
```

{ attribute_instance } interface [ lifetime ] interface_identifier
{ package_import_declaration } [ parameter_port_list ] list_of_ports ;
```ebnf
interface_ansi_header ::=
```

{attribute_instance } interface [ lifetime ] interface_identifier
{ package_import_declaration }1 [ parameter_port_list ] [ list_of_port_declarations ] ;
```ebnf
program_nonansi_header ::=
```

{ attribute_instance } program [ lifetime ] program_identifier
{ package_import_declaration } [ parameter_port_list ] list_of_ports ;
```ebnf
program_ansi_header ::=
```

{attribute_instance } program [ lifetime ] program_identifier
{ package_import_declaration }1 [ parameter_port_list ] [ list_of_port_declarations ] ;
1)
A package_import_declaration in a module_ansi_header, interface_ansi_header, or program_ansi_header shall be
followed by a parameter_port_list or list_of_port_declarations, or both.
Syntax 26-3—Package import in header syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
Package items that are imported as part of a module, interface, or program header are visible throughout the
module, interface, or program, including in parameter and port declarations.
For example:
package A;
typedef struct {
bit [ 7:0] opcode;
bit [23:0] addr;
} instruction_t;
endpackage: A
package B;
typedef enum bit {FALSE, TRUE} boolean_t;
endpackage: B
module M import A::instruction_t, B::*;
#(WIDTH = 32)
(input
[WIDTH-1:0]
data,
input
instruction_t
a,
output [WIDTH-1:0]
result,
output boolean_t
OK
);
...
endmodule: M
### 26.5 Search order rules

Table 26-1 describes the search order rules for the declarations imported from a package. For the purposes
of the discussion that follows, consider the following package declarations:
package p;
typedef enum { FALSE, TRUE } BOOL;
const BOOL c = FALSE;
endpackage

package q;
const int c = 0;
endpackage
When using a wildcard import, a reference to an undefined identifier that is declared within the package
causes that identifier to be imported into the scope of the import statement. However, an error results if the
same identifier is later declared or explicitly imported in the same scope. This is shown in the following
example:
module m;
import q::*;
Table 26-1—Scoping rules for package importation
Example
Description
In a scope

In a scope
containing a
wildcard
import of c
(import q::*)
u = p::c;
y = p::TRUE;
A qualified
package identi-
fier is visible in
any scope

OK
Direct reference

age p.
OK
Direct reference

p.
OK
Direct reference
to c refers to
the c imported
from package
p.
OK
Direct reference
to c refers to the
c imported from
package q.
OK / ERROR
c is undefined in
the importing
scope. Thus, a
direct reference
to c is illegal
and results in an
error.
The import
clause is other-
wise allowed.
import p::c;

. . .
if( ! c ) ...
The imported
identifier c

directly visible
in the import-
ing scope.
ERROR
It is illegal to
import an iden-
tifier defined in
the importing
scope.
OK
Direct reference
to c refers to
the c imported
from package
p.
ERROR
It is illegal to
import the same
identifier from
different
packages.
OK / ERROR
The import of
p::c makes
any prior
reference to c
illegal.
Otherwise,
direct reference
to c refers to the
c imported from
package p.

endmodule
### 26.6 Exporting imported names from packages

By default, declarations imported into a package are not visible by way of subsequent imports of that
package. Package export declarations allow a package to specify that imported declarations are to be made
visible in subsequent imports. A package export may precede a corresponding package import.
The syntax for package exports is shown in Syntax 26-4.
```ebnf
package_export_declaration ::=
```

// from A.2.1.3
export *::* ;
| export package_import_item { , package_import_item } ;
Syntax 26-4—Package export syntax (excerpt from Annex A)
An export of the form package_name::* exports all declarations that were actually imported from
package_name within the context of the exporting package. All names from package_name, whether
imported directly or through wildcard imports, are made available. Symbols that are candidates for import
but not actually imported are not made available. The special wildcard export form, export *::*; ,
exports all imported declarations from all packages from which imports occur.
An export of the form package_name::name makes the given declaration available. It shall be an error if
the given declaration is not a candidate for import or if the declaration is not actually imported in the
package. The declaration being exported shall be imported from the same package_name used in the
export. If the declaration is an unreferenced candidate for import, the export shall be considered to be a
reference and shall import the declaration into the package following the same rules as for a direct import of
the name.
An import of a declaration made visible through an export is equivalent to an import of the original
declaration. Thus direct or wildcard import of a declaration by way of multiple exported paths does not
cause conflicts.
It is valid to specify multiple exports that export the same actual declaration.
Examples:
package p1;
int x, y;
endpackage
package p2;
import p1::x;
export p1::*;
// exports p1::x as the name "x";
// p1::x and p2::x are the same declaration
endpackage
package p3;
import p1::*;
import p2::*;
export p2::*;

int q = x;
// p1::x and q are made available from p3. Although p1::y
// is a candidate for import, it is not actually imported
// since it is not referenced. Since p1::y is not imported,
// it is not made available by the export.
endpackage
package p4;
import p1::*;
export p1::*;
int y = x;
// y is available as a direct declaration;
// p1::x is made available by the export
endpackage
package p5;
import p4::*;
import p1::*;
export p1::x;
export p4::x;
// p4::x refers to the same declaration
// as p1::x so this is legal.
endpackage
package p6;
import p1::*;
export p1::x;
int x;
// Error. export p1::x is considered to
// be a reference to "x" so a subsequent
// declaration of x is illegal.
endpackage
package p7;
int y;
endpackage
package p8;
export *::*;
// Exports both p7::y and p1::x.
import p7::y;
import p1::x;
endpackage
module top;
import p2::*;
import p4::*;
int y = x;
// x is p1::x
endmodule
### 26.7 The std built-in package

SystemVerilog provides a built-in package that can contain system types (e.g., classes), variables, tasks, and
functions. Users cannot insert additional declarations into the built-in package.
The contents of the standard built-in package are defined in Annex G.
Authorized licensed use limited to: Richard DJE. Downloaded on April 22,2021 at 14:18:32 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.
IEEE Std 1800-2017
IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog—Unified Hardware Design, Specification, and Verification Language
785
Copyright © 2018 IEEE. All rights reserved.
The built-in package is implicitly wildcard imported into the compilation-unit scope of every compilation
unit (see 3.12.1). Thus, declarations in the built-in package are directly available in any other scope (like
system tasks and system functions) unless they are redefined by user code.
Declarations in the standard built-in package can also be directly referenced using the syntax shown in
Syntax 26-5.
```ebnf
built_in_data_type ::= [ std :: ] data_type_identifier
built_in_function_call ::= [ std :: ] function_subroutine_call
```

Syntax 26-5—Std package import syntax (not in Annex A)
The package name std followed by the package scope resolution operator :: can be used to unambiguously
access names in the built-in package. For example:
std::sys_task();
// unambiguously call the system provided sys_task
Unlike system tasks and system functions, tasks and functions in the built-in package need not be prefixed
with a $ to avoid collisions with user-defined identifiers. This mechanism allows functional extensions to
the language in a backward compatible manner, without the addition of new keywords or polluting local
name spaces.
