# Changelog Index

This chapter is an index — pointers into other docs that carry the full changelog detail. Use it to find what changed in a given release.

## Where the canonical changelogs live

| Source | Granularity | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/contracts/PGEN_REGEX_PARSER_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md` | Per-release shape change | The authoritative contract. Each release's section lists the AST shape changes consumers care about. |
| `docs/contracts/PGEN_RELEASED_PARSER_BUG_LEDGER.md` | Per-bug | When a bug is fixed in a release, the ledger entry records the input/output shape change. |
| `CHANGES.md` (root) | Per-release | Human-readable summary of all changes. |
| Git tags + commit log | Commit-by-commit | The most granular source. |

When investigating "what changed and why," start with the contract document, drop down to the ledger for specific bugs, fall back to git for diffs.

## Releases relevant to this book

This book documents the regex parser at the **6e5b0f23** state — that's:

- **Release 1.1.33** (parser version) — schema-affecting through slice 2 of the typed-shape campaign.
- **Contract 1.1.35** (contract document version).

Below are the shape-change highlights of recent releases, with pointers to the contract sections.

### 1.1.33 / Contract 1.1.35 — quant_suffix typed (slice 2/N)

**What changed:** `quant_suffix` rule's two branches each got a return annotation: `"?"` → `"lazy"`, `"+"` → `"possessive"`. The `quant_suffix?` slot inside `quantifier` now carries either `[]` (greedy, no suffix matched) or `["lazy"]` / `["possessive"]` (1-element Quantified-?).

**Consumer impact:** consumers reading the quantifier shape can dispatch on the string instead of inferring from which branch matched. See [Quantifier Subtree](rules-quantifier.md).

**Contract section:** "Release 1.1.33 / Contract 1.1.35 Highlights".

### 1.1.32 / Contract 1.1.34 — digits typed (slice 1/N)

**What changed:** `digits` rule got `@transform: str::parse::<usize>().unwrap_or(0)` annotation. The rule now emits a typed integer (`Json(Value::Number(usize))`) instead of a `Terminal` of digit characters.

**Consumer impact:** consumers reading counted-quantifier bounds get the integer directly. See [Quantifier Subtree](rules-quantifier.md).

**Contract section:** "Release 1.1.32 / Contract 1.1.34 Highlights".

### 1.1.31 / Contract 1.1.33 — PGEN-RGX-0074 `\Q...\E` correctness

**What changed:** introduced the `piece_quoted_run_quantified` rule + the `**` flatten-spread operator. Restructured `concatenation` to `piece+ -> [$1**]`. The `\Q...\E quantifier` shape now emits per-char piece array with the trailing piece carrying the quantifier — matching PCRE2's "quantifier binds to last char of \Q...\E" semantics.

**Consumer impact:** **breaking** — any consumer that walked the pre-1.1.31 whole-block-quantified shape will see a different AST. The new shape is what PCRE2 says it should be. Drop any pre-existing `\Q...\E`-quantifier-attachment workaround. See [\Q...\E Quoted Literals](examples-quoted-literal.md).

**Contract section:** "Release 1.1.31 / Contract 1.1.33 Highlights".

### 1.1.30 / Contract 1.1.32 — PGEN-RGX-0073 perf closure

**What changed:** primary focus was performance — closing all 8 patterns under p50 < 50µs. Schema-affecting changes were minor: implicit `-> $1` default tightened to exclude `Quantified` bodies (so single-Quantified rules without an explicit annotation no longer collapse to the inner item). Several rule rewrites of slow Or-of-chars rules using `/.../` regex literals (perf-only, no shape change).

**Consumer impact:** if a consumer relied on the implicit-collapse behavior for a Quantified body, they need to add an explicit `-> $1` annotation to that rule (or update their walker to handle the un-collapsed shape). Vanishingly rare in practice — the regex grammar didn't have any rules in this position. See contract for full details.

**Contract section:** "Release 1.1.30 / Contract 1.1.32 Highlights".

## Earlier releases (pre-1.1.30)

Pre-1.1.30 the regex parser used the recursive-envelope shape exclusively — no `Json` carrier, every rule produced `Sequence` / `Alternative` / `Quantified` / `Terminal`. Consumers who built against pre-1.1.30 should read [Migration from the Recursive Envelope](migration-from-recursive-envelope.md) before reading the rest of this book.

For shape-affecting changes within the pre-1.1.30 envelope era, see the contract document — its release sections go back to the parser's earliest releases.

## Future releases

Upcoming slice campaign work (task #40 — "Annotate regex.ebnf for full AST usability"):

| Slice | Target rule | Expected AST change |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `counted_quantifier_body` | Typed `{min, max}` Json (with `null` for absent max) |
| 4+ | TBD per cadence | One rule per slice |

Each slice will:

- Bump the contract version.
- Add a row to this index.
- Get a CHANGES.md entry.
- Get a corresponding chapter update where applicable.

The eventual schema 1.0.0 milestone will land when every regex.ebnf rule is either annotated or has a deliberate "remain raw envelope" decision documented.

## Looking up a specific input's behavior

If you need to know "what does the parser output for input X across release Y?," the workflow is:

1. Check `git log --oneline grammars/regex.ebnf` to see when the rule for X was last touched.
2. Check the contract section for that release.
3. Check the ledger if there was a bug fix involved.
4. As last resort, check out the relevant tag and run `parseability_probe --parse-dump-ast-pretty regex 'X'` against it.

For consumer-side regression detection, the recommended pattern is the snapshot test described in [Schema Versioning](schema-versioning.md).
